# {metadata.title}

In this chapter, you'll learn how to install and run a Medusa application using Docker.

The main supported installation method is using [create-medusa-app](../page.mdx). However, since it requires prerequisites like PostgreSQL, Docker may be a preferred and easier option for some users. You can follow this guide to set up a Medusa application with Docker in this case.

You can follow this guide on any operating system that supports Docker, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 1. Clone Medusa Starter Repository

To get started, clone the Medusa Starter repository that a Medusa application is based on:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/medusajs/medusa-starter-default.git --depth=1 my-medusa-store
```

This command clones the repository into a directory named `my-medusa-store`.

---

## 2. Create `docker-compose.yml`

In the cloned repository, create a file named `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  # PostgreSQL Database
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    container_name: medusa_postgres
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: medusa-store
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - medusa_network

  # Redis
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    container_name: medusa_redis
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    networks:
      - medusa_network

  # Medusa Server
  # This service runs the Medusa backend application
  # and the admin dashboard.
  medusa:
    build: .
    container_name: medusa_backend
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/medusa-store
      - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    networks:
      - medusa_network

volumes:
  postgres_data:

networks:
  medusa_network:
    driver: bridge
```

You define three services in this file:

- `postgres`: The PostgreSQL database service that stores your Medusa application's data.
- `redis`: The Redis service that stores session data.
- `medusa`: The Medusa service that runs the server and the admin dashboard. It connects to the PostgreSQL and Redis services.

You can add environment variables either in the `environment` section of the `medusa` service or in a separate `.env` file.

### Recommendations for Multiple Local Projects

If this isn't the first Medusa project you're setting up with Docker on your machine, make sure to:

- Change the `container_name` for each service to avoid conflicts.
    - For example, use `medusa_postgres_myproject`, `medusa_redis_myproject`, and `medusa_backend_myproject` instead of the current names.
- Change the volume names to avoid conflicts.
    - For example, use `postgres_data_myproject` instead of `postgres_data`.
- Change the network name to avoid conflicts.
    - For example, use `medusa_network_myproject` instead of `medusa_network`.
- Change the ports to avoid conflicts with other projects. For example:
    - Use `"5433:5432"` for PostgreSQL.
    - Use `"6380:6379"` for Redis.
    - Use `"9001:9000"` for the Medusa server.
- Update the `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` environment variables accordingly.

---

## 3. Create `start.sh`

Next, you need to create a script file that [runs database migrations](../../fundamentals/data-models/write-migration/page.mdx) and starts the Medusa development server.

Create the file `start.sh` with the following content:

<CodeTabs group="npm2yarn" defaultValue="yarn">
  <CodeTab value="yarn" label="Yarn">
```shell title="start.sh"
#!/bin/sh

# Run migrations and start server
echo "Running database migrations..."
npx medusa db:migrate

echo "Seeding database..."
yarn seed || echo "Seeding failed, continuing..."

echo "Starting Medusa development server..."
yarn dev
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab value="npm" label="NPM">
```shell title="start.sh"
#!/bin/sh

# Run migrations and start server
echo "Running database migrations..."
npx medusa db:migrate

echo "Seeding database..."
npm run seed || echo "Seeding failed, continuing..."

echo "Starting Medusa development server..."
npm run dev
```
  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

Make sure to give the script executable permissions:

<Note>

Setting permissions isn't necessary on Windows, but it's recommended to run this command on Unix-based systems like macOS and Linux.

</Note>

```bash
chmod +x start.sh
```

---

## 4. Create `Dockerfile`

The `Dockerfile` defines how the Medusa service is built.

Create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:

<CodeTabs group="npm2yarn" defaultValue="yarn">
  <CodeTab value="yarn" label="Yarn">
```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
# Development Dockerfile for Medusa
FROM node:20-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /server

# Copy package files and yarn config
COPY package.json yarn.lock .yarnrc.yml ./

# Install all dependencies using yarn
RUN yarn install

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Expose the port Medusa runs on
EXPOSE 9000

# Start with migrations and then the development server
CMD ["./start.sh"]
```
  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab value="npm" label="NPM">
```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
# Development Dockerfile for Medusa
FROM node:20-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /server

# Copy package files and npm config
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install all dependencies using npm
RUN npm install

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Expose the port Medusa runs on
EXPOSE 9000

# Start with migrations and then the development server
CMD ["./start.sh"]
```
  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

In the `Dockerfile`, you use the `node:20-alpine` image as the base since Medusa requires Node.js v20 or later.

Then, you set the working directory to `/server`, copy the necessary files, install dependencies, expose the `9000` port that Medusa uses, and run the `start.sh` script to start the server.

<Note>

While it's more common to use `/app` as the working directory, it's highly recommended to use `/server` for the Medusa service to avoid conflicts with Medusa Admin customizations. Learn more in [this troubleshooting guide](!resources!/troubleshooting/medusa-admin/no-widget-route#errors-in-docker).

</Note>

---

## 5. Install Dependencies

The Medusa Starter repository has a `yarn.lock` file that was generated by installing dependencies with Yarn v1.22.19.

If you're using a different Yarn version, or you're using NPM, you need to install the dependencies again to ensure compatibility with the Docker setup.

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install
```

This will update `yarn.lock` or generate a `package-lock.json` file, depending on your package manager.

---

## 6. Update Scripts in `package.json`

Next, you need to update the `scripts` section in your `package.json` file to start the development server using Docker.

Add the following scripts in `package.json`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    // Other scripts...
    "docker:up": "docker compose up --build -d",
    "docker:down": "docker compose down"
  }
}
```

Where:

- `docker:up` starts the development server in a Docker container as a background process.
- `docker:down` stops and removes the Docker containers.

---

## 7. Update Medusa Configuration

If you try to run the Medusa application now with Docker, you'll encounter an SSL error as the server tries to connect to the PostgreSQL database.

To resolve the error, add the following configurations in `medusa-config.ts`:

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
import { loadEnv, defineConfig } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

loadEnv(process.env.NODE_ENV || "development", process.cwd())

module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    // ...
    databaseDriverOptions: {
      ssl: false,
      sslmode: "disable",
    },
  },
})
```

You add the [projectConfig.databaseDriverOptions](../../configurations/medusa-config/page.mdx#databasedriveroptions) to disable SSL for the PostgreSQL database connection.

---

## 8. Add `.dockerignore`

To ensure only the necessary files are copied into the Docker image, create a `.dockerignore` file with the following content:

```dockerignore title=".dockerignore"
node_modules
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
.git
.gitignore
README.md
.env.test
.nyc_output
coverage
.DS_Store
*.log
dist
build
```

---

## 9. Create `.env` File

You can add environment variables either in the `environment` section of the `medusa` service in `docker-compose.yml` or in a separate `.env` file.

If you don't want to use a `.env` file, you can remove the `env_file` section from the `medusa` service in `docker-compose.yml`.

Otherwise, copy the `.env.template` file to `.env` and update the values as needed.

---

## 10. Start the Medusa Application with Docker

All configurations are now ready. You can start the Medusa application using Docker by running the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run docker:up
```

Docker will pull the necessary images, start the PostgreSQL and Redis services, build the Medusa service, and run the development server in a Docker container.

You can check the logs to ensure everything is running smoothly with the following command:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

Once you see the following message, the Medusa server and admin are ready:

```shell
✔ Server is ready on port: 9000 – 3ms
info:    Admin URL → http://localhost:9000/app
```

You can now access the Medusa server at `http://localhost:9000` and the Medusa admin dashboard at `http://localhost:9000/app`.

<Feedback
  question="Did the Docker installation finish successfully?"
  negativeQuestion="What errors or issues did you run into?"
  showDottedSeparator={false}
  positiveBtn="Yes"
  negativeBtn="No"
/>

---

## Create Admin User

To create an admin user, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose run --rm medusa npx medusa user -e admin@example.com -p supersecret
```

Make sure to replace `admin@example.com` and `supersecret` with your desired email and password.

You can now log in to the Medusa admin dashboard at `http://localhost:9000/app` using the email and password you just created.

---

## Stop the Medusa Application Running in Docker

To stop the Medusa application running in Docker, run the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run docker:down
```

This command stops and removes the Docker containers created by the `docker-compose.yml` file.

This doesn't delete any data in your application or its database. You can start the server again using the `docker:up` command.

---

## Check Logs

You can check the logs of the Medusa application running in Docker using the following command:

```bash
docker compose logs -f medusa
```

This command shows the logs of the `medusa` service, allowing you to see any errors or messages from the Medusa application.
