In this chapter, you'll learn about the Medusa Admin dashboard and the possible ways to customize it.

## What is the Medusa Admin?

The Medusa Admin is an intuitive dashboard that allows merchants to manage their ecommerce store. It provides management features related to products, orders, customers, and more.

<Note title="Tip">

To explore more what you can do with the Medusa Admin, check out the [User Guide](!user-guide!). These user guides are designed for merchants and provide the steps to perform any task within the Medusa Admin.

</Note>

The Medusa Admin is built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/). When you [install the Medusa application](../../installation/page.mdx), you also install the Medusa Admin. Then, when you start the Medusa application, you can access the Medusa Admin at `http://localhost:9000/app`.

<Note title="Tip">

If you don't have an admin user, use the [Medusa CLI](!resources!/medusa-cli/commands/user) to create one.

## How to Customize the Medusa Admin?

You can customize the Medusa Admin dashboard by:

- Adding new sections to existing pages using [Widgets](./widgets/page.mdx).
- Adding new pages using [UI Routes](./ui-routes/page.mdx).

The next chapters will cover these two topics in detail.

### What You Can't Customize in the Medusa Admin

You can't customize the admin dashboard's layout, design, or the content of the existing pages (aside from injecting widgets).

If your use case requires heavy customization of the admin dashboard, you can build a custom admin dashboard using Medusa's [Admin API routes](!api!/admin).

## Medusa UI Package

Medusa provides a Medusa UI package to facilitate your admin development through ready-made components and ensure a consistent design between your customizations and the dashboardâ€™s design.

Refer to the [Medusa UI documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/ui) to learn how to install it and use its components.
