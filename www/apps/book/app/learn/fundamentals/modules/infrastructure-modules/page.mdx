In this chapter, you’ll learn about Infrastructure Modules.

## What is an Infrastructure Module?

An Infrastructure Module implements features and mechanisms related to the Medusa application’s architecture and infrastructure.

Since modules are interchangeable, you have more control over Medusa’s architecture. For example, you can choose to use Memcached for event handling instead of Redis.
