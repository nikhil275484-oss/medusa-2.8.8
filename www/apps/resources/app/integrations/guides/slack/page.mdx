# {metadata.title}

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Slack with Medusa to receive notifications about created orders.

When you install a Medusa application, you get a fully-fledged commerce platform with a Framework for customization. Medusa's architecture facilitates integrating third-party services to customize Medusa's infrastructure for your business needs.

Medusa's [Notification Module](../../../infrastructure-modules/notification/page.mdx) allows you to customize Medusa's infrastructure to send notifications using the third-party provider that fits your business needs, such as [Slack](https://slack.com/).

In this tutorial, you'll integrate Slack with Medusa to receive notifications about created orders.

## Summary

By following this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Install and set up Medusa.
- Integrate Slack with Medusa.
- Handle Medusa's `order.placed` event to send notifications to Slack.

You can follow this tutorial whether you're new to Medusa or an advanced Medusa developer.

## Step 1: Install a Medusa Application

<Prerequisites items={[
  {
    text: "Node.js v20+",
    link: "https://nodejs.org/en/download"
  },
  {
    text: "Git CLI tool",
    link: "https://git-scm.com/downloads"
  },
  {
    text: "PostgreSQL",
    link: "https://www.postgresql.org/download/"
  }
]} />

Start by installing the Medusa application on your machine with the following command:

```bash
npx create-medusa-app@latest
```

First, you'll be asked for the project's name. Then, when prompted about installing the [Next.js Starter Storefront](../../../nextjs-starter/page.mdx), choose "Yes."

Afterwards, the installation process will start, which will install the Medusa application in a directory with your project's name and the Next.js Starter Storefront in a separate directory named `{project-name}-storefront`.

<Note title="Why is the storefront installed separately?">

The Medusa application is composed of a headless Node.js server and an admin dashboard. The storefront is installed or custom-built separately and connects to the Medusa application through its REST endpoints, called [API routes](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/api-routes). Learn more in [Medusa's Architecture documentation](!docs!/learn/introduction/architecture).

</Note>

Once the installation finishes successfully, the Medusa Admin dashboard will open with a form to create a new user. Enter the user's credentials and submit the form. Afterwards, you can log in with the new user and explore the dashboard.

<Note title="Ran into Errors?">

Check out the [troubleshooting guides](../../../troubleshooting/create-medusa-app-errors/page.mdx) for help.

</Note>

---

## Step 2: Create Slack Module Provider

To integrate third-party services into Medusa, you create a custom [module](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/modules). A module is a reusable package with functionalities related to a single feature or domain.

Medusa's [Notification Module](../../../infrastructure-modules/notification/page.mdx) provides an interface to send notifications in your Medusa application. It delegates the actual sending of notifications to the underlying provider, such as Slack.

In this step, you'll integrate Slack as a Notification Module Provider. Later, you'll use it to send a notification when an order is created.

<Note>

Refer to the [Modules](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/modules) documentation to learn more about modules in Medusa.

</Note>

### a. Install Axios

To send requests to Slack, you'll use the [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) library. So, run the following command to install it in your Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install axios
```

You'll use Axios in the module's service.

### b. Create Module Directory

A module is created under the `src/modules` directory of your Medusa application. So, create the directory `src/modules/slack`.

### c. Create Slack Module's Service

A module has a service that contains its logic. For Notification Module Providers, the service implements the logic to send notifications with a third-party service.

To create the service of the Slack Notification Module Provider, create the file `src/modules/slack/service.ts` with the following content:

export const serviceHighlights = [
  ["6", "webhook_url", "The Slack webhook URL to send notifications to."],
  ["7", "admin_url", "The URL of the Medusa Admin dashboard, used to add links in the notifications."],
  ["13", "identifier", "The unique identifier for the module provider."],
]

```ts title="src/modules/slack/service.ts" highlights={serviceHighlights}
import { 
  AbstractNotificationProviderService,
} from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

type Options = {
  webhook_url: string
  admin_url: string
}

type InjectedDependencies = {}

class SlackNotificationProviderService extends AbstractNotificationProviderService {
  static identifier = "slack"
  protected options: Options

  constructor(container: InjectedDependencies, options: Options) {
    super()
    this.options = options
  }
}
```

A Notification Module Provider's service must extend the `AbstractNotificationProviderService` class. You'll implement its methods in a bit.

The service must also have an `identifier` static property, which is a unique identifier for the module. This identifier is used when registering the module in the [Medusa container](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/medusa-container).

The service's constructor receives two parameters:

- `container`: The [module's container](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/modules/container) that contains Framework resources available to the module. You don't need to access any resources for this provider.
- `options`: Options that are passed to the module provider when it's registered in Medusa's configurations. You define the following options:
    - `webhook_url`: The Slack webhook URL to send notifications to.
    - `admin_url`: The URL of the Medusa Admin dashboard, which you'll use to add links in the notifications.

<Note>

You'll learn how to set these options when you [add the module provider to Medusa's configurations](#g-add-module-provider-to-medusas-configurations).

</Note>

In the constructor, you set the `options` property to the passed options.

In the next sections, you'll implement the methods of the `AbstractNotificationProviderService` class.

<Note>

Refer to the [Create Notification Module Provider](/references/notification-provider-module) guide for detailed information about the methods.

</Note>

### d. Implement validateOptions Method

The `validateOptions` method is used to validate the options passed to the module provider. If the method throws an error, the Medusa application won't start.

So, add the `validateOptions` method to the `SlackNotificationProviderService` class:

```ts title="src/modules/slack/service.ts"
// other imports...
import { 
  MedusaError,
} from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

class SlackNotificationProviderService extends AbstractNotificationProviderService {
  // ...
  static validateOptions(options: Record<any, any>): void | never {
    if (!options.webhook_url) {
      throw new MedusaError(
        MedusaError.Types.INVALID_ARGUMENT,
        "Webhook URL is required"
      )
    }
    if (!options.admin_url) {
      throw new MedusaError(
        MedusaError.Types.INVALID_ARGUMENT,
        "Admin URL is required"
      )
    }
  }
}
```

The `validateOptions` method receives the options passed to the module provider as a parameter.

In the method, you throw an error if any of the options are not set.

### e. Implement send Method

When the Medusa application needs to send a notification through a channel (such as Slack), it calls the `send` method of the channel's module provider.

You'll first add helper methods that you'll use in the `send` method. Then, you'll implement the `send` method itself.

#### getDisplayAmount Method

The first method you'll add is a method to format amounts for displaying them in notifications. So, add the `getDisplayAmount` method to the `SlackNotificationProviderService` class:

```ts title="src/modules/slack/service.ts"
class SlackNotificationProviderService extends AbstractNotificationProviderService {
  // ...
  private async getDisplayAmount(amount: number, currencyCode: string) {
    return Intl.NumberFormat("en-US", {
      style: "currency",
      currency: currencyCode,
    }).format(amount)
  }
}
```

The `getDisplayAmount` method receives an amount and a currency code and returns the formatted amount as a string.

#### sendOrderNotification Method

Next, you'll add a method to format a Slack message for created orders. So, add the `sendOrderNotification` method to the `SlackNotificationProviderService` class:

export const sendOrderNotificationHighlights = [
  ["12", "order", "The order to send a notification for."],
  ["20", "blocks", "Format the slack message as blocks."],
  ["96", "axios", "Send the formatted message to Slack using Axios."],
]

```ts title="src/modules/slack/service.ts" highlights={sendOrderNotificationHighlights}
// other imports...
import { 
  OrderDTO, 
  ProviderSendNotificationDTO, 
  ProviderSendNotificationResultsDTO,
} from "@medusajs/framework/types"
import axios from "axios"

class SlackNotificationProviderService extends AbstractNotificationProviderService {
  // ...
  async sendOrderNotification(notification: ProviderSendNotificationDTO) {
    const order = notification.data?.order as OrderDTO
    if (!order) {
      throw new MedusaError(
        MedusaError.Types.NOT_FOUND,
        "Order not found"
      )
    }
    const shippingAddress = order.shipping_address
    const blocks: Record<string, unknown>[] = [
      {
        type: "section",
        text: {
          type: "mrkdwn",
          text: `Order *<${this.options.admin_url}/orders/${order.id}|#${order.display_id}>* has been created.`,
        },
      },
    ]

    if (shippingAddress) {
      blocks.push({
        type: "section",
        text: {
          type: "mrkdwn",
          text: `*Customer*\n${shippingAddress.first_name} ${
            shippingAddress.last_name
          }\n${order.email}\n*Destination*\n${
            shippingAddress.address_1
          }\n${
            shippingAddress.city
          }, ${(shippingAddress.country_code as string).toUpperCase()}`,
        },
      })
    }

    blocks.push(
      {
        type: "section",
        text: {
          type: "mrkdwn",
          text: `*Subtotal*\t${await this.getDisplayAmount(order.subtotal as number, order.currency_code)}\n*Shipping*\t${
            await this.getDisplayAmount(order.shipping_total as number, order.currency_code)
          }\n*Discount Total*\t${await this.getDisplayAmount(
            order.discount_total as number,
            order.currency_code
          )}\n*Tax*\t${await this.getDisplayAmount(order.tax_total as number, order.currency_code)}\n*Total*\t${
            await this.getDisplayAmount(order.total as number, order.currency_code)
          }`,
        },
      },
      {
        type: "divider",
      }
    )

    await Promise.all(
      order.items?.map(async (item) => {
        const line: Record<string, unknown> = {
          type: "section",
          text: {
            type: "mrkdwn",
            text: `*${item.title}*\n${item.quantity} x ${await this.getDisplayAmount(
              item.unit_price as number,
              order.currency_code
            )}`,
          },
        }
  
        if (item.thumbnail) {
          const url = item.thumbnail
  
          line.accessory = {
            type: "image",
            alt_text: "Item",
            image_url: url,
          }
        }
  
        blocks.push(line)
        blocks.push({
          type: "divider",
        })
      }) || []
    )

    await axios.post(this.options.webhook_url, {
      text: `Order ${order.display_id} was created`,
      blocks,
    })

    return {
      id: order.id,
    }
  }
}
```

The `sendOrderNotification` method receives a `ProviderSendNotificationDTO` object, which is the object passed to the `send` method that you'll implement next. The object has a `data` property that contains the order data.

In the method, you format the Slack message to show the order's ID, customer information, shipping address, order items, and total amounts. You also add a link to the order's details page in the Medusa Admin dashboard.

Finally, you send the formatted message to Slack using the `axios.post` method with the configured webhook URL.

#### send Method

You can now implement the `send` method, which is the method that Medusa calls to send notifications using the provider. Add the `send` method to the `SlackNotificationProviderService` class:

```ts title="src/modules/slack/service.ts"
class SlackNotificationProviderService extends AbstractNotificationProviderService {
  // ...
  async send(
    notification: ProviderSendNotificationDTO
  ): Promise<ProviderSendNotificationResultsDTO> {
    const { template } = notification

    switch (template) {
      case "order-created":
        return this.sendOrderNotification(notification)
      default:
        throw new MedusaError(
          MedusaError.Types.NOT_FOUND,
          `Template ${template} not supported`
        )
    }
  }
}
```

The `send` method receives a `ProviderSendNotificationDTO` object, which contains the notification data and the template to use for sending the notification.

<Note>

The method receives other parameters, which you can find in the [Create Notification Module Provider](/references/notification-provider-module#send) guide.

</Note>

In the method, you check the `template` property of the notification object. If it's `order-created`, you call the `sendOrderNotification` method to send the notification. Otherwise, you throw an error indicating that the template is not supported.

### f. Export Module Definition

You've now finished implementing the necessary methods for the Slack Notification Module Provider.

The final piece to a module is its definition, which you export in an `index.ts` file at the module's root directory. This definition tells Medusa the module's details, including its service.

To create the module's definition, create the file `src/modules/slack/index.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/modules/slack/index.ts"
import SlackNotificationProvider from "./service"
import { 
  ModuleProvider, 
  Modules,
} from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

export default ModuleProvider(Modules.NOTIFICATION, {
  services: [SlackNotificationProvider],
})
```

You use `ModuleProvider` from the Modules SDK to create the module provider's definition. It accepts two parameters:

1. The name of the module that this provider belongs to, which is `Modules.NOTIFICATION` in this case.
2. An object with a required property `services` indicating the Module Provider's services.

### g. Add Module Provider to Medusa's Configurations

Once you finish building the module, add it to Medusa's configurations to start using it.

In `medusa-config.ts`, add a `modules` property:

export const configHighlights = [
  ["10", "id", "The ID of the module provider, used to register it."],
  ["12", "channels", "The channels that this provider is used to send notifications."],
  ["13", "webhook_url", "The Slack webhook URL to send notifications to."],
  ["14", "admin_url", "The URL of the Medusa Admin dashboard, used to add links in the notifications."]
]

```ts title="medusa-config.ts" highlights={configHighlights}
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  modules: [
    {
      resolve: "@medusajs/medusa/notification",
      options: {
        providers: [
          {
            resolve: "./src/modules/slack",
            id: "slack",
            options: {
              channels: ["slack"],
              webhook_url: process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL,
              admin_url: process.env.SLACK_ADMIN_URL,
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

To pass a Notification Module Provider to the Notification Module, you add the `modules` property to the Medusa configuration and pass the Notification Module in its value.

The Notification Module accepts a `providers` option, which is an array of Notification Module Providers to register.

To register the Slack Notification Module Provider, you add an object to the `providers` array with the following properties:

- `resolve`: The NPM package or path to the module provider. In this case, it's the path to the `src/modules/slack` directory.
- `id`: The ID of the module provider. The Notification Module Provider is then registered with the ID `np_{identifier}_{id}`, where:
    - `{identifier}`: The identifier static property defined in the Module Provider's service, which is `slack` in this case.
    - `{id}`: The ID set in this configuration, which is also `slack` in this case.
- `options`: The options to pass to the module provider. These are the options you defined in the `Options` interface of the module provider's service.
    - You must also set a `channel` option that indicates the channel this provider is used to send notifications.

### h. Set Options as Environment Variables

Next, you'll set the options you passed to the Slack Notification Module Provider as environment variables.

To set the webhook URL, you need to create a Slack application and configure a webhook URL. To do that:

1. Go to your [Slack Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) page.
2. Click the "Create New App" button.

![Slack Apps page interface showing the prominent green "Create New App" button in the top navigation area, which initiates the process of creating a new Slack application for integrating with external services like Medusa](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1748940543/Medusa%20Resources/CleanShot_2025-06-03_at_10.43.01_2x_zadmwn.png)

3. In the pop-up, choose "From scratch".
4. Enter the app's name and select the workspace to install it in.
5. Once you're done, click the "Create App" button.

![Slack app creation modal dialog with options to create app "From scratch" or "From an app manifest", including form fields for app name and workspace selection, with a "Create App" button to confirm the new Slack application setup](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1748940602/Medusa%20Resources/CleanShot_2025-06-03_at_10.43.52_2x_edqawv.png)

6. In the app's settings, go to the "Incoming Webhooks" section.
7. Enable the "Activate Incoming Webhooks" toggle.

![Slack app configuration page showing the Incoming Webhooks settings with the "Activate Incoming Webhooks" toggle switch prominently displayed, which enables the app to receive webhook notifications from external services like Medusa](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1748940647/Medusa%20Resources/CleanShot_2025-06-03_at_10.44.07_2x_rykabg.png)

8. In the "Webhook URLs for Your Workspace" section, click the "Add New Webhook" button.

![Webhook configuration section displaying the "Add New Webhook" button in the "Webhook URLs for Your Workspace" area, allowing users to create a new webhook endpoint for receiving automated notifications in their Slack workspace](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1748940671/Medusa%20Resources/CleanShot_2025-06-03_at_10.44.33_2x_e7qk8o.png)

9. Select the channel or conversation to send notifications to and click the "Allow" button.
10. Copy the generated webhook URL.

![Slack webhook URL generation interface showing the newly created webhook URL with a copy button, which provides the unique endpoint URL needed to configure Medusa for sending automated notifications to the selected Slack channel](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1748940718/Medusa%20Resources/CleanShot_2025-06-03_at_10.45.51_2x_xet5u5.png)

Then, in the `.env` file of your Medusa application, set the `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` and `SLACK_ADMIN_URL` environment variables:

```shell title=".env"
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/...
SLACK_ADMIN_URL=http://localhost:9000/app
```

In development, the Medusa Admin dashboard is running on `http://localhost:9000/app`, so you can use that URL for the `SLACK_ADMIN_URL` environment variable.

You'll test out the integration when you handle the `order.placed` event in the next step.

---

## Step 3: Handle the `order.placed` Event

Now that you've integrated Slack with Medusa, you can send notifications to Slack at any point, including when an order is created.

To send a notification to Slack when an order is created, you will:

- Implement the order details retrieval and notification sending with Slack in a [workflow](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows). A workflow is a series of actions, called steps, that complete a task with rollback and retry mechanisms.
- Listen to the `order.placed` event in a [subscriber](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers). A subscriber is an asynchronous function that listens to events to perform actions, such as execute a workflow, when the event is emitted.

### a. Create the Workflow

The workflow to send notifications to Slack will have the following steps:

<WorkflowDiagram
  workflow={{
    name: "orderPlacedNotificationWorkflow",
    steps: [
      {
        type: "step",
        name: "useQueryGraphStep",
        description: "Retrieve the order details.",
        link: "/references/helper-steps/useQueryGraphStep",
        depth: 1
      },
      {
        type: "step",
        name: "sendNotificationsStep",
        description: "Send a notification with a configured provider.",
        link: "/references/medusa-workflows/steps/sendNotificationsStep",
        depth: 1
      }
    ]
  }}
  hideLegend
/>

Medusa provides both steps in its `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

So, to create the workflow, create the file `src/workflows/order-placed-notification.ts` with the following content:

export const orderPlacedNotificationWorkflowHighlights = [
  ["13", "useQueryGraphStep", "Retrieve the order details using the Query Graph."],
  ["34", "sendNotificationsStep", "Send a notification to Slack with the order details."]
]

```ts title="src/workflows/order-placed-notification.ts" highlights={orderPlacedNotificationWorkflowHighlights}
import { 
  createWorkflow, 
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import { sendNotificationsStep, useQueryGraphStep } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

type WorkflowInput = {
  id: string
}

export const orderPlacedNotificationWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "order-placed-notification",
  ({ id }: WorkflowInput) => {
    const { data: orders } = useQueryGraphStep({
      entity: "order",
      fields: [
        "id",
        "display_id", 
        "email",
        "shipping_address.*",
        "subtotal",
        "shipping_total",
        "currency_code", 
        "discount_total",
        "tax_total",
        "total",
        "items.*",
        "original_total",
      ],
      filters: {
        id,
      },
    })

    sendNotificationsStep([{
      to: "slack-channel", // This will be configured in the Slack app
      channel: "slack",
      template: "order-created",
      data: {
        order: orders[0],
      },
    }])
  }
)
```

You create a workflow using `createWorkflow` from the Workflows SDK. It accepts the workflow's unique name as a first parameter.

It accepts as a second parameter a constructor function, which is the workflow's implementation. The function can accept input, which in this case is an object holding the ID of the order placed.

In the workflow's constructor function, you:

- Retrieve the order's details using the `useQueryGraphStep`. This step uses Medusa's [Query](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/module-links/query) tool to retrieve data across modules. You pass it the order ID to retrieve.
- Send a notification using the `sendNotificationsStep`. You pass the step an array of notifications to send, and each notification is an object with the following properties:
  - `to`: The channel to send the notification to. Since you configure this in the Slack app, you just set it to `slack-channel`.
  - `channel`: The channel to use for sending the notification. By setting it to `slack`, the Notification Module will use the Slack Notification Module Provider to send the notification.
  - `template`: The template to use for sending the notification, which is `order-created` in this case.
  - `data`: The data payload to pass with the notification, which contains the order details.

You now have a workflow that retrieves the order details and sends a notification to Slack when an order is placed.

<Note>

Refer to the [Workflows](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows) documentation to learn more about workflows and steps.

</Note>

### b. Create the Subscriber

To execute the workflow when an order is placed, you need to create a subscriber that listens to the `order.placed` event and executes the workflow.

To create the subscriber, create the file `src/subscribers/order-placed.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/subscribers/order-placed.ts"
import { SubscriberArgs, SubscriberConfig } from "@medusajs/framework"
import { 
  orderPlacedNotificationWorkflow,
} from "../workflows/order-placed-notification"

export default async function orderPlacedHandler({
  event: { data },
  container,
}: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
  await orderPlacedNotificationWorkflow(container)
    .run({
      input: data,
    })
}

export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
  event: "order.placed",
}
```

A subscriber file must export:

1. An asynchronous function, which is the subscriber that is executed when the event is emitted.
2. A configuration object that holds the name of the event that the subscriber listens to, which is `order.placed` in this case.

The subscriber function receives an object as a parameter that has the following properties:

- `event`: An object that holds the event's data payload. The payload of the `order.placed` event is the ID of the order placed.
- `container`: The [Medusa container](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/medusa-container) to access the Framework and commerce tools.

In the subscriber function, you execute the `orderPlacedNotificationWorkflow` by invoking it, passing the Medusa container as a parameter. Then, you chain a `run` method, passing it the order ID from the event's data payload as input.

<Note>

Refer to the [Events and Subscribers](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers) documentation to learn more about creating subscribers.

### Test it Out

You'll now test out the integration by placing an order using the [Next.js Starter Storefront](../../../nextjs-starter/page.mdx).

<Note title="Reminder" forceMultiline>

The Next.js Starter Storefront was installed in a separate directory from Medusa. The directory's name is `{your-project}-storefront`.

So, if your Medusa application's directory is `medusa-slack`, you can find the storefront by going back to the parent directory and changing to the `medusa-slack-storefront` directory:

```bash
cd ../medusa-slack-storefront # change based on your project name
```

</Note>

First, start the Medusa application by running the following command in the Medusa application's directory:

```bash npm2yarn badgeLabel="Medusa Application" badgeColor="green"
npm run dev
```

Then, start the Next.js Starter Storefront by running the following command in the storefront's directory:

```bash npm2yarn badgeLabel="Next.js Starter Storefront" badgeColor="blue"
npm run dev
```

Next, open the Next.js Starter Storefront in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`. Add a product to the cart, proceed to checkout, and place an order.

Afterwards, you'll receive a notification in the Slack channel you configured in the Slack app. The notification will contain the order details.

You can also click on the order's ID in the notification to open the order's details page in the Medusa Admin dashboard.

## Next Steps

You've now integrated Slack with Medusa to receive notifications about created orders. You can expand on this integration to send other types of notifications, such as order updates. Refer to the [Events Reference](/references/events) for a list of events you can listen to in your subscribers.

You can also customize the notifications to include more information or change the format of the messages. Refer to [Slack's documentation](https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/formatting) for more information on how to format messages in Slack.

If you're new to Medusa, check out the [main documentation](!docs!/learn), where you'll get a more in-depth understanding of all the concepts you've used in this guide and more.
