In this Pricing Module guide, you'll learn about tired prices, price rules for price sets and price lists, and how to add rules to a price.

<Note title="Looking for no-code docs?">

You can manage prices and tiers using the Medusa Admin:

- [Edit shipping option prices with conditions](!user-guide!/settings/locations-and-shipping/locations#fixed-and-conditional-shipping-option-prices).
- [Add price lists to set prices with conditions for product variants](!user-guide!/price-lists).

</Note>

## Tiered Pricing

Each price, represented by the [Price data model](/references/pricing/models/Price), has two optional properties that can be used to create tiered prices:

- `min_quantity`: The minimum quantity that must be in the cart for the price to be applied.
- `max_quantity`: The maximum quantity that can be in the cart for the price to be applied.

This is useful to set tiered pricing for resources like product variants and shipping options.

For example, you can set a variant's price to:

- `$10` by default.
- `$8` when the customer adds `10` or more of the variant to the cart.
- `$6` when the customer adds `20` or more of the variant to the cart.

These price definitions would look like this:

```json title="Example Prices"
[
  // default price
  {
    "amount": 10,
    "currency_code": "usd",
  },
  {
    "amount": 8,
    "currency_code": "usd",
    "min_quantity": 10,
    "max_quantity": 19,
  },
  {
    "amount": 6,
    "currency_code": "usd",
    "min_quantity": 20,
  },
],
```

### How to Create Tiered Prices?

When you create prices, you can specify a `min_quantity` and `max_quantity` for each price. This allows you to create tiered pricing, where the price changes based on the quantity of items in the cart.

For example:

<Note>

For most use cases where you're building customizations in the Medusa application, it's highly recommended to use [Medusa's workflows](../../../medusa-workflows-reference/page.mdx) rather than using the Pricing Module directly. Medusa's workflows already implement extensive functionalities that you can re-use in your custom flows, with reliable roll-back mechanism.

</Note>

  ["20", "min_quantity", "The minimum quantity that must be in the cart for the price to be applied."],

    input: {
      products: [{
        variants: [{
          id: "variant_1",
          prices: [
            // default price
            {
              amount: 10,
              currency_code: "usd",
            },
            {
              amount: 8,
              currency_code: "usd",
              min_quantity: 10,
              max_quantity: 19,
            },
            {
              amount: 6,
              currency_code: "usd",
              min_quantity: 20,
            },
          ],
          // ...
        }],
      }],
      // ...
    },
  })
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Using the Pricing Module" value="pricing-module">

```ts
const priceSet = await pricingModule.addPrices({
  priceSetId: "pset_1",
  prices: [
    // default price
    {
      amount: 10,
      currency_code: "usd",
    },
    // tiered prices
    {
      amount: 8,
      currency_code: "usd",
      min_quantity: 10,
      max_quantity: 19,
    },
    {
      amount: 6,
      currency_code: "usd",
      min_quantity: 20,
    },
  ],
})
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

In this example, you create a product with a variant whose default price is `$10`. You also add two tiered prices that set the price to `$8` when the quantity is between `10` and `19`, and to `$6` when the quantity is `20` or more.

### How are Tiered Prices Applied?

The [price calculation](../price-calculation/page.mdx) mechanism considers the cart's items as a context when choosing the best price to apply.

For example, consider the customer added the `variant_1` product variant (created in the workflow snippet of the [above section](#how-to-create-tiered-prices)) to their cart with a quantity of `15`.

The price calculation mechanism will choose the second price, which is `$8`, because the quantity of `15` is between `10` and `19`.

<Note>

If there are other rules applied to the price, they may affect the price calculation. Keep reading to learn about other price rules, and refer to the [Price Calculation](../price-calculation/page.mdx) guide for more details on the calculation mechanism.

</Note>

## Price Rule

You can also restrict prices by advanced rules, such as a customer's group, zip code, or a cart's total.

Each rule of a price is represented by the [PriceRule data model](/references/pricing/models/PriceRule).

The `Price` data model has a `rules_count` property, which indicates how many rules, represented by `PriceRule`, are applied to the price.

For exmaple, you create a price restricted to `10557` zip codes.

![A diagram showcasing the relation between the PriceRule and Price](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1709648772/Medusa%20Resources/price-rule-1_vy8bn9.jpg)

A price can have multiple price rules.

For example, a price can be restricted by a region and a zip code.

![A diagram showcasing the relation between the PriceRule and Price with multiple rules.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1709649296/Medusa%20Resources/price-rule-3_pwpocz.jpg)

### Price List Rules

Rules applied to a price list are represented by the [PriceListRule data model](/references/pricing/models/PriceListRule).

The `rules_count` property of a `PriceList` indicates how many rules are applied to it.

![A diagram showcasing the relation between the PriceSet, PriceList, Price, RuleType, and PriceListRuleValue](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1709641999/Medusa%20Resources/price-list_zd10yd.jpg)

### How to Create Prices with Rules?

When you create prices, you can specify rules for each price. This allows you to create complex pricing strategies based on different contexts.

For example:

<Note>

For most use cases where you're building customizations in the Medusa application, it's highly recommended to use [Medusa's workflows](../../../medusa-workflows-reference/page.mdx) rather than using the Pricing Module directly. Medusa's workflows already implement extensive functionalities that you can re-use in your custom flows, with reliable roll-back mechanism.

<CodeTabs group="price-example">
  <CodeTab label="Using Medusa Workflows" value="workflows">

export const workflowHighlights = [
  ["19", "rules", "The default price doesn't have rules."],
  ["27", "attribute", "Apply the price if the cart or order's total matches the condition."]
]

```ts highlights={workflowHighlights}
const { result } = await createShippingOptionsWorkflow(container)
  .run({
    input: [{
      name: "Standard Shipping",
      service_zone_id: "serzo_123",
      shipping_profile_id: "sp_123",
      provider_id: "prov_123",
      type: {
        label: "Standard",
        description: "Standard shipping",
        code: "standard",
      },
      price_type: "flat",
      prices: [
        // default price
        {
          currency_code: "usd",
          amount: 10,
          rules: [],
        },
        // price if cart total >= $100
        {
          currency_code: "usd",
          amount: 0,
          rules: [
            {
              attribute: "item_total",
              operator: "gte",
              value: 100,
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    }],
  })
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="Using the Pricing Module" value="pricing-module">

```ts
const priceSet = await pricingModule.addPrices({
  priceSetId: "pset_1",
  prices: [
    // default price
    {
      currency_code: "usd",
      amount: 10,
      rules: {},
    },
    // price if cart total >= $100
    {
      currency_code: "usd",
      amount: 0,
      rules: {
        item_total: {
          operator: "gte",
          value: 100,
        },
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

In this example, you create a shipping option whose default price is `$10`. When the total of the cart or order using this shipping option is greater than `$100`, the shipping option's price becomes free.

### How is the Price Rule Applied?

The [price calculation](../price-calculation/page.mdx) mechanism considers a price applicable when the resource that this price is in matches the specified rules.

For example, a [cart object](!api!/store#carts_cart_schema) has an `item_total` property. So, if a shipping option has the following price:

```json
{
  "currency_code": "usd",
  "amount": 0,
  "rules": {
    "item_total": {
      "operator": "gte",
      "value": 100,
    }
  }
}
```

The shipping option's price is applied when the cart's `item_total` is greater than or equal to `$100`.

You can also apply the rule on nested relations and properties. For example, to apply a shipping option's price based on the customer's group, you can apply a rule on the `customer.group.id` attribute:

```json
{
  "currency_code": "usd",
  "amount": 0,
  "rules": {
    "customer.group.id": {
      "operator": "eq",
      "value": "cusgrp_123"
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the price is only applied if a cart's customer belongs to the customer group of ID `cusgrp_123`.

<Note>

These same rules apply to product variant prices as well, or any other resource that has a price.
