In this document, you’ll learn what a payment is and how it's created, captured, and refunded.

## What's a Payment?

When a payment session is authorized, a payment, represented by the [Payment data model](/references/payment/models/Payment), is created. This payment can later be captured or refunded.

A payment carries many of the data and relations of a payment session:

- It belongs to the same payment collection.
- It’s associated with the same payment provider, which handles further payment processing.
- It stores the payment session’s `data` property in its `data` property, as it’s still useful for the payment provider’s processing.

## Capture Payments

When a payment is captured, a capture, represented by the [Capture data model](/references/payment/models/Capture), is created. It holds details related to the capture, such as the amount, the capture date, and more.

The payment can also be captured incrementally, each time a capture record is created for that amount.

## Refund Payments

When a payment is refunded, a refund, represented by the [Refund data model](/references/payment/models/Refund), is created. It holds details related to the refund, such as the amount, refund date, and more.

A payment can be refunded multiple times, and each time a refund record is created.

## data Property

Payment providers may need additional data to process the payment later. For example, the ID of the associated payment in the third-party provider.

The `Payment` data model has a `data` property used to store that data. The first time it's set is when the [payment provider in Medusa](../payment-provider/page.mdx) authorizes the payment.

Then, the `data` property is passed to the Medusa payment provider when the payment is captured or refunded, allowing the payment provider to utilize the data to process the payment with the third-party provider.

<Note title="Tip">

If you're building a custom payment provider, learn more about authorizing and capturing the payments and setting the `data` property in the [Create Payment Provider](/references/payment/provider) guide.
