## What is a Tax Region?

A tax region, represented by the [TaxRegion data model](/references/tax/models/TaxRegion), stores tax settings related to a region that your store serves.

Tax regions can inherit settings and rules from a parent tax region.

## Tax Rules in a Tax Region

Tax rules define the tax rates and behavior within a tax region. They specify:

- The tax rate percentage.
- Which products the tax applies to.
- Other custom rules to determine tax applicability.

Learn more about tax rules in the [Tax Rates and Rules](../tax-rates-and-rules/page.mdx) guide.

## Tax Provider

Each tax region can have a default tax provider. The tax provider is responsible for calculating the tax lines for carts and orders in that region.

You can use Medusa's default tax provider or create a custom one, allowing you to integrate with third-party tax services or implement your own tax calculation logic.

Learn more about tax providers in the [Tax Provider](../tax-provider/page.mdx) guide.
