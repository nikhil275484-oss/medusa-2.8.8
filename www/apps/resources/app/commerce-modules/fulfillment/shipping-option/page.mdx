In this document, you’ll learn about shipping options and their rules.

## What’s a Shipping Option?

A shipping option is a way of shipping an item. Each fulfillment provider provides a set of shipping options. For example, a provider may provide a shipping option for express shipping and another for standard shipping.

When the customer places their order, they choose a shipping option to be used to fulfill their items.

A shipping option is represented by the [ShippingOption data model](/references/fulfillment/models/ShippingOption).

## Service Zone Restrictions

A shipping option is restricted by a service zone, limiting the locations a shipping option be used in.

For example, a fulfillment provider may have a shipping option that can be used in the United States, and another in Canada.

Service zones can be more restrictive, such as restricting to certain cities or province codes.

<Note title="Tip">

The province code is always in lower-case and in [ISO 3166-2 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2).

## Shipping Option Rules

You can restrict shipping options by custom rules, such as the item’s weight or the customer’s group.

<Note title="Tip">

You can also restrict a shipping option's price based on specific conditions. For example, you can make a shipping option's price free based on the cart's total. Learn more in the Pricing Module's [Price Rules](../../pricing/price-rules/page.mdx#how-to-set-rules-on-a-price) guide.

</Note>

These rules are represented by the [ShippingOptionRule data model](/references/fulfillment/models/ShippingOptionRule). Its properties define the custom rule:

- `attribute`: The name of a property or table that the rule applies to. For example, `customer_group`.
- `operator`: The operator used in the condition. For example:
    - To allow multiple values, use the operator `in`, which validates that the provided values are in the rule’s values.
    - To create a negation condition that considers `value` against the rule, use `nin`, which validates that the provided values aren’t in the rule’s values.
- `value`: One or more values.

A shipping option can have multiple rules. For example, you can add rules to a shipping option so that it's available if the customer belongs to the VIP group and the total weight is less than 2000g.

## Shipping Profile and Types

A shipping option belongs to a type. For example, a shipping option’s type may be `express`, while another `standard`. The type is represented by the [ShippingOptionType data model](/references/fulfillment/models/ShippingOptionType).

A shipping option also belongs to a shipping profile, as each shipping profile defines the type of items to be shipped in a similar manner.

## data Property

When fulfilling an item, you might use a third-party fulfillment provider that requires additional custom data to be passed along from the checkout or order-creation process.

The `ShippingOption` data model has a `data` property. It's an object that stores custom data relevant later when creating and processing a fulfillment.
