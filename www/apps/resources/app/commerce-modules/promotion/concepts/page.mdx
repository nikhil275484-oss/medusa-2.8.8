## What is a Promotion?

A promotion, represented by the [Promotion data model](/references/promotion/models/Promotion), is a discount that can be applied on cart items, shipping methods, or entire orders.

A promotion has two types:

- `standard`: A standard promotion with rules.
- `buyget`: “A buy X get Y” promotion with rules.

## Promotion Rules

A promotion can be restricted by a set of rules, each rule is represented by the [PromotionRule data model](/references/promotion/models/PromotionRule).

For example, you can create a promotion that only customers of the `VIP` customer group can use.

![A diagram showcasing the relation between Promotion and PromotionRule](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1709833196/Medusa%20Resources/promotion-promotion-rule_msbx0w.jpg)

A `PromotionRule`'s `attribute` property indicates the property's name to which this rule is applied. For example, `customer_group_id`.

The expected value for the attribute is stored in the `PromotionRuleValue` data model. So, a rule can have multiple values.

When testing whether a promotion can be applied to a cart, the rule's `attribute` property and its values are tested on the cart itself.

For example, the cart's customer must be part of the customer group(s) indicated in the promotion rule's value.

### Flexible Rules

The `PromotionRule`'s `operator` property adds more flexibility to the rule’s condition rather than simple equality (`eq`).

For example, to restrict the promotion to only `VIP` and `B2B` customer groups:

- Add a `PromotionRule` record with its `attribute` property set to `customer_group_id` and `operator` property to `in`.
- Add two `PromotionRuleValue` records associated with the rule: one with the value `VIP` and the other `B2B`.

![A diagram showcasing the relation between PromotionRule and PromotionRuleValue when a rule has multiple values](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1709897383/Medusa%20Resources/promotion-promotion-rule-multiple_hctpmt.jpg)

In this case, a customer’s group must be in the `VIP` and `B2B` set of values to use the promotion.

## How to Apply Rules on a Promotion?

### Using Workflows

If you're managing promotions using [Medusa's workflows](../../../medusa-workflows-reference/page.mdx) or the API routes that use them, you can specify rules for the promotion or its [application method](../application-method/page.mdx).

For example, if you're creating a promotion using the [createPromotionsWorkflow](/references/medusa-workflows/createPromotionsWorkflow):

```ts
const { result } = await createPromotionsWorkflow(container)
  .run({
    input: {
      promotionsData: [{
        code: "10OFF",
        type: "standard",
        status: "active",
        application_method: {
          type: "percentage",
          target_type: "items",
          allocation: "across",
          value: 10,
          currency_code: "usd",
        },
        rules: [
          {
            attribute: "customer.group.id",
            operator: "eq",
            values: [
              "cusgrp_123",
            ],
          },
        ],
      }],
    },
  })
```

In this example, the promotion is restricted to customers with the `cusgrp_123` customer group.

### Using Promotion Module's Service

<Note>

For most use cases, it's recommended to use [workflows](#using-workflows) instead of directly using the module's service.

</Note>

If you're managing promotions using the Promotion Module's service, you can specify rules for the promotion or its [application method](../application-method/page.mdx) in its methods.

For example, if you're creating a promotion with the [createPromotions](/references/promotion/createPromotions) method:

```ts
const promotions = await promotionModuleService.createPromotions([
  {
    code: "50OFF",
    type: "standard",
    status: "active",
    application_method: {
      type: "percentage",
      target_type: "items",
      value: 50,
    },
    rules: [
      {
        attribute: "customer.group.id",
        operator: "eq",
        values: [
          "cusgrp_123",
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
])
```

In this example, the promotion is restricted to customers with the `cusgrp_123` customer group.

### How is the Promotion Rule Applied?

A promotion is applied on a resource if its attributes match the promotion's rules.

For example, consider you have the following promotion with a rule that restricts the promotion to a specific customer:

```json
{
  "code": "10OFF",
  "type": "standard",
  "status": "active",
  "application_method": {
    "type": "percentage",
    "target_type": "items",
    "allocation": "across",
    "value": 10,
    "currency_code": "usd"
  },
  "rules": [
    {
      "attribute": "customer_id",
      "operator": "eq",
      "values": [
        "cus_123"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

When you try to apply this promotion on a cart, the cart's `customer_id` is compared to the promotion rule's value based on the specified operator. So, the promotion will only be applied if the cart's `customer_id` is equal to `cus_123`.
