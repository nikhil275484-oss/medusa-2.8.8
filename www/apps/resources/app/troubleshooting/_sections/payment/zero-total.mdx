If your cart has a total of `0`, you might encounter an `unknown error` when trying to create a payment session.

## Why this Error Occurred

Some payment providers, such as Stripe, require a non-zero amount to create a payment session. So, if your cart has a total of `0`, the error will be thrown on the payment provider's side.

## Solutions

### Initialize Payment Session Only for Non-Zero Totals

Make sure the payment session is only initialized when the cart has a total greater than `0`. You can add a check before creating the payment session:

```ts
if (cart.total > 0) {
  // TODO Initialize payment session
}
```

### Use Manual System Payment Provider

Use payment providers like the Manual System Payment Provider, which doesn't create a payment session with a third-party provider.

The Manual System Payment Provider is available by default in Medusa and can be used to handle payments without a third-party provider. It allows you to mark the order as paid without requiring any additional actions from the customer.

Make sure to configure the Manual System Payment Provider in your store's region. Learn more in the [Manage Region](!user-guide!/settings/regions#edit-region-details) user guide.
