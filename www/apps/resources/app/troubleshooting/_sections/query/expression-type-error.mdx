<Note type="success" title="Issue Resolved">

This issue has been resolved in [Medusa v2.8.5+](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.8.5). If you're facing this error, please [update your Medusa application](!docs!/learn/update) and run the `dev` command. If the issue persists, please [report it on GitHub](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/issues/new/choose).

</Note>

If you get the following error while using `query.graph` or `useQueryGraphStep`:

```bash
Expression produces a union type that is too complex to represent. ts(2590)
```

## Why this Error Occurred

This type error may occur when you use Query, but it's only a type error that doesn't affect the functionality of your code. It occurs because the models you're retrieving may be too complicated for the TypeScript compiler to infer the types correctly.

---

## How to Fix it

You can ignore this error by using the `// @ts-ignore` directive before the line of code that produces the error. For example:

<CodeTabs group="query">
  <CodeTab label="query.graph" value="query.graph">

```ts
// @ts-ignore
const { data } = await query.graph({
  // ...
})
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="useQueryGraphStep" value="useQueryGraphStep">

```ts
// @ts-ignore
const { data } = useQueryGraphStep({
  // ...
})
```

  </CodeTab>

</CodeTabs>
