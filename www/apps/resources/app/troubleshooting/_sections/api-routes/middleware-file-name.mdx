A common mistake when creating middlewares is naming the file `middleware.ts` rather than `middlewares.ts`.

If your middleware isn't registered correctly, make sure you've created the middleware file at `src/api/middlewares.ts`.

Learn more in the [Middleware](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/middlewares) documentation.
