This reference provides examples to different filtering mechanisms and scenarios.

## Methods that Accept Filters

Some of the data model repository's methods allow you to pass filters, including:

<Table>
  <Table.Header>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.HeaderCell>
        Method
      </Table.HeaderCell>
      <Table.HeaderCell>
        Filter Parameter
      </Table.HeaderCell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Header>
  <Table.Body>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        [find](../../methods/find/page.mdx)
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        Accepts a `where` property in its first parameter to pass filters.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        [findAndCount](../../methods/findAndCount/page.mdx)
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        Accepts a `where` property in its first parameter to pass filters.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        [delete](../../methods/delete/page.mdx)
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        Accepts an object as a first parameter to pass filters.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        [softDelete](../../methods/softDelete/page.mdx)
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        Accepts an object as a first parameter to pass filters.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        [restore](../../methods/restore/page.mdx)
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        Accepts an object as a first parameter to pass filters.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Body>
</Table>

While the examples in this reference are based on the `find` method, the same filtering mechanisms apply to the other methods.

---

## Match Exact Value

```ts
const posts = await this.postRepository_.find({
  where: {
    title: "My Post",
  },
})
```

If you pass a property with its value, only records whose properties exactly match the value are selected.

In the example above, only posts having the title `My Post` are retrieved.

---

## Doesn't Match Exact Value

```ts
const posts = await this.postRepository_.find({
  where: {
    title: {
      $ne: "My Post",
    },
  },
})
```

To find records with a property that doesn't match a value, pass an object with a `$ne` property. Its value is the value that a record's property shouldn't match.

In the example above, only posts that don't have the title `My Post` are retrieved.

---

## Match Multiple Values

```ts
const posts = await this.postRepository_.find({
  where: {
    views: [
      50,
      100,
    ],
  },
})
```

To find records with a property matching multiple values, pass an array of those values as the property's value in the filter.

In the example above, only posts having either `50` or `100` views are retrieved.

---

## Don't Match Multiple Values

```ts
const posts = await this.postRepository_.find({
  where: {
    title: {
      $nin: ["My Post", "My Post 2"],
    },
  },
})
```

To find records with a property that doesn't match one or more values, pass an object with a `$nin` property. Its value is an array of multiple values that a record's property shouldn't match.

In the example above, only posts that don't have the title `My Post` are retrieved.

---

## Match Text Like Value

<Note>

This filter only applies to text-like properties, including `text`, `id`, and `enum` properties.

</Note>

```ts
const posts = await this.postRepository_.find({
  where: {
    title: {
      $like: "My%",
    },
  },
})
```

To perform a `like` filter on a record's property, set the property's value to an object with a `$like` property. Its value is the string to use when applying the `like` filter.

The example above matches all posts whose title starts with `My`.

---

## Filter by Null or Not Null

To retrieve records with a property that is `null`, set the property's value to `null`.

For example:

```ts
const posts = await this.postRepository_.find({
  where: {
    published_at: null,
  },
})
```
In the example above, only posts that have a `null` publish date are retrieved.

On the other hand, to retrieve records with a property that isn't `null`, set the property's value to an object with a `$ne` property.

For example:

```ts
const posts = await this.postRepository_.find({
  where: {
    published_at: {
      $ne: null,
    },
  },
})
```

In the example above, only posts that have a publish date are retrieved.

---

## Apply Range Filters

<Note>

This filter only applies to the `number` and `dateTime` properties.

</Note>

```ts
const posts = await this.postRepository_.find({
  where: {
    published_at: {
      $lt: new Date(),
    },
  },
})
```

To filter a record's property to be within a range, set the property's value to an object with any of the following properties:

1. `$lt`: The property's value must be less than the supplied value.
2. `$lte`: The property's value must be less than or equal to the supplied value.
3. `$gt`: The property's value must be greater than the supplied value.
4. `$gte`: The property's value must be greater than or equal the supplied value.

In the example above, only posts whose `published_at` property is before the current date and time are retrieved.

### Example: Retrieve Posts Published Today

```ts
const startToday = new Date()
startToday.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0)

const endToday = new Date()
endToday.setHours(23, 59, 59, 59)

const posts = await this.postRepository_.find({
  where: {
    published_at: {
      $gte: startToday,
      $lte: endToday,
    },
  },
})
```

The `dateTime` property also stores the time. So, when matching for an exact day, you must set a range filter to be between the beginning and end of the day.

In this example, you retrieve the current date twice: once to set its time to `00:00:00`, and another to set its time `23:59:59`. Then, you retrieve posts whose `published_at` property is between `00:00:00` and `23:59:59` of today.

### Example: Range Filter on Number Property

```ts
const posts = await this.postRepository_.find({
  where: {
    views: {
      $gte: 50,
      $lte: 100,
    },
  },
})
```

In the example above, only posts with `views` between `50` and `100` are retrieved.

---

## Apply Or Condition

```ts
const posts = await this.postRepository_.find({
  where: {
    $or: [
      {
        title: "My Post",
      },
      {
      published_at: {
          $lt: new Date(),
        },
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

To use an `or` condition, pass to the filter object the `$or` property, whose value is an array of filters.

In the example above, posts whose title is `My Post` or their `published_at` date is less than the current date and time are retrieved.

---

## Apply And Condition

```ts
const posts = await this.postRepository_.find({
  where: {
    $and: [
      {
        title: "My Post",
      },
      {
        published_at: {
          $lt: new Date(),
        },
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

To use an `and` condition, pass to the filter object the `$and` property, whose value is an array of filters.

In the example above, only posts whose title is `My Post` and their `published_at` date is less than the current date and time are retrieved.

---

## Complex Filters Example

```ts
const posts = await this.postRepository_.find({
  where: {
    $or: [
      {
        $and: [
          { views: { $gte: 50 } },
          { 
            published_at: {
              $gte: new Date(new Date().getFullYear(), 0, 1),
            },
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        title: {
          $like: "%Featured%",
        },
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

In the example above, posts are retrieved if they meet either of the following conditions:

1. The post has at least `50` views and was published after the beginning of the current year.
2. The post's title contains the word `Featured`.

By combining `and` and `or` conditions, you can create complex filters to retrieve records that meet specific criteria.
