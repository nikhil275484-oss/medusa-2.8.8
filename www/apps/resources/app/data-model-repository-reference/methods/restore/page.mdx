# {metadata.title}

The `restore` method of a data model repository restores one or more records of the data model that were previously soft-deleted.

This means that the `deleted_at` property of the records is set to `null`.

<Note>

This reference assumes you've already resolved the data model repository, as explained in the [Data Model Repository Reference](../../page.mdx) documentation.

## `restore` Parameters

## Restore Record by ID

```ts
import { 
  InjectTransactionManager,
  MedusaContext,
  MedusaService,
} from "@medusajs/framework/utils"
import { Context, InferTypeOf, DAL } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
import { EntityManager } from "@mikro-orm/knex"
import Post from "./models/post"

class BlogModuleService extends MedusaService({
  Post,
}){
  // ...
  @InjectTransactionManager()
  protected async doSomething_(
    id: string,
    @MedusaContext() sharedContext?: Context<EntityManager>
  ): Promise<any> {
    const [
      restoredPosts, 
      restoredEntities,
    ] = await this.postRepository_.restore(id)

    return restoredPosts
  }

  @InjectManager()
  async doSomething(
    id: string,
    @MedusaContext() sharedContext?: Context<EntityManager>
  ): Promise<any> {
    return await this.doSomething_(id, sharedContext)
  }
}
```

### Parameters

The `restore` method can accept the ID of a record to restore as a string.

### Returns

The method returns a tuple with two elements:

- The first element is an array of the restored records.
- The second element is an object whose keys are the names of restored data models, and values an array of restored record objects.
    - This is useful if records from other data models were previously soft-deleted due to cascading soft-deletes, and are now restored.

For example:

```json title="Example"
[
  [
    {
      "id": "01JSHAW6Z7KW4X6E8MFPGNEKHC",
      "title": "My first post",
      "content": "This is my first post",
      "metadata": null,
      "product_id": null,
      "product_ids": [
        "prod_01JP4M5T5K55P2JN1F17EY7B2T"
      ],
      "author_id": "01JSHAW6YZNKR65TJ242GCMD2S",
      "author": "01JSHAW6YZNKR65TJ242GCMD2S",
      "created_at": "2025-04-23T12:44:59.751Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-04-23T12:44:59.751Z",
      "deleted_at": "2025-04-23T12:45:08.750Z"
    }
  ],
  {
    "Post": [
      {
        "id": "01JSHAW6Z7KW4X6E8MFPGNEKHC",
        "title": "My first post",
        "content": "This is my first post",
        "metadata": null,
        "product_id": null,
        "product_ids": [
          "prod_01JP4M5T5K55P2JN1F17EY7B2T"
        ],
        "author_id": "01JSHAW6YZNKR65TJ242GCMD2S",
        "author": "01JSHAW6YZNKR65TJ242GCMD2S",
        "created_at": "2025-04-23T12:44:59.751Z",
        "updated_at": "2025-04-23T12:44:59.751Z",
        "deleted_at": "2025-04-23T12:45:08.750Z"
      }
    ]
  }

## Restore Multiple Records By IDs

```ts
import { 
  InjectTransactionManager,
  MedusaContext,
  MedusaService,
} from "@medusajs/framework/utils"
import { Context, InferTypeOf, DAL } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
import { EntityManager } from "@mikro-orm/knex"
import Post from "./models/post"

class BlogModuleService extends MedusaService({
  Post,
}){
  // ...
  @InjectTransactionManager()
  protected async doSomething_(
    ids: string[],
    @MedusaContext() sharedContext?: Context<EntityManager>
  ): Promise<any> {
    const [
      restoredPosts, 
      restoredEntities,
    ] = await this.postRepository_.restore(ids)

    return restoredPosts
  }

  @InjectManager()
  async doSomething(
    ids: string[],
    @MedusaContext() sharedContext?: Context<EntityManager>
  ): Promise<any> {
    return await this.doSomething_(ids, sharedContext)
  }
}
```

### Parameters

The `restore` method can accept an array of record IDs to restore.

### Returns

The method returns a tuple with two elements:

- The first element is an array of the restored records.
- The second element is an object whose keys are the names of restored data models, and values an array of restored record objects.
    - This is useful if records from other data models were previously soft-deleted due to cascading soft-deletes, and are now restored.

## Restore Records by Filters

```ts
import { 
  InjectTransactionManager,
  MedusaContext,
  MedusaService,
} from "@medusajs/framework/utils"
import { Context, InferTypeOf, DAL } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
import { EntityManager } from "@mikro-orm/knex"
import Post from "./models/post"

class BlogModuleService extends MedusaService({
  Post,
}){
  // ...
  @InjectTransactionManager()
  protected async doSomething_(
    id: string,
    @MedusaContext() sharedContext?: Context<EntityManager>
  ): Promise<any> {
    const [
      restoredPosts, 
      restoredEntities,
    ] = await this.postRepository_.restore({
      title: "My Post",
    })

    return restoredPosts
  }

  @InjectManager()
  async doSomething(
    ids: string[],
    @MedusaContext() sharedContext?: Context<EntityManager>
  ): Promise<any> {
    return await this.doSomething_(ids, sharedContext)
  }
}
```

### Parameters

The `restore` method can accept an object of filters to select the records to restore.

In the example above, you pass an object with the `title` property to restore all records with that title.

<Note>

Find examples of different filters in the [Filter Records](../../tips/filtering/page.mdx) documentation.

</Note>

### Returns

The method returns a tuple with two elements:

- The first element is an array of the restored records.
- The second element is an object whose keys are the names of restored data models, and values an array of restored record objects.
    - This is useful if records from other data models were previously soft-deleted due to cascading soft-deletes, and are now restored.
