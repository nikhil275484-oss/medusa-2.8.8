Medusa's architectural functionalities, such as emitting and subscribing to events or caching data, are all implemented in Infrastructure Modules. An Infrastructure Module is a package that can be installed and used in any Medusa application. These modules allow you to choose and integrate custom services for architectural purposes.

For example, you can use our [Redis Event Module](./event/redis/page.mdx) to handle event functionalities, or create a custom module that implements these functionalities with Memcached. Learn more in [the Architecture documentation](!docs!/learn/introduction/architecture).

This section of the documentation showcases Medusa's Infrastructure Modules, how they work, and how to use them in your Medusa application.

## Analytics Module

<Note>

The Analytics Module is available starting [Medusa v2.8.3](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.8.3).

</Note>

The Analytics Module exposes functionalities to track and analyze user interactions and system events. For example, tracking cart updates or completed orders. Learn more in the [Analytics Module documentation](./analytics/page.mdx).

{/* The Analytics Module has module providers that implement the underlying logic of integrating third-party services for tracking analytics. The following Analytics Module Providers are provided by Medusa. You can also create a custom provider as explained in the [Create Analytics Module Provider guide](/references/analytics/provider). */}
