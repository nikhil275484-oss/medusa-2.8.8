# {metadata.title}

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to implement first-purchase discounts in Medusa.

When you install a Medusa application, you get a fully-fledged commerce platform with a Framework for customization. The Medusa application's commerce features are built around [Commerce Modules](../../../commerce-modules/page.mdx), which are available out-of-the-box. These features include promotion and cart management features.

The first-purchase discount feature encourages customers to sign up and make their first purchase by offering them a discount. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to implement this feature in Medusa.

## Summary

By following this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Install and set up Medusa.
- Apply a first-purchase discount to a customer's cart if they are a first-time customer.
- Add custom validation to ensure the discount is only used by first-time customers.
- Customize the Next.js Starter Storefront to display a pop-up encouraging first-time customers to sign up and receive a discount.

You can follow this tutorial whether you're new to Medusa or an advanced Medusa developer.

## Step 1: Install a Medusa Application

<Prerequisites items={[
  {
    text: "Node.js v20+",
    link: "https://nodejs.org/en/download"
  },
  {
    text: "Git CLI tool",
    link: "https://git-scm.com/downloads"
  },
  {
    text: "PostgreSQL",
    link: "https://www.postgresql.org/download/"
  }
]} />

Start by installing the Medusa application on your machine with the following command:

```bash
npx create-medusa-app@latest
```

First, you'll be asked for the project's name. Then, when prompted about installing the [Next.js Starter Storefront](../../../nextjs-starter/page.mdx), choose "Yes."

Afterward, the installation process will start, which will install the Medusa application in a directory with your project's name and the Next.js Starter Storefront in a separate directory named `{project-name}-storefront`.

<Note title="Why is the storefront installed separately?">

The Medusa application is composed of a headless Node.js server and an admin dashboard. The storefront is installed or custom-built separately and connects to the Medusa application through its REST endpoints, called [API routes](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/api-routes). Learn more in [Medusa's Architecture documentation](!docs!/learn/introduction/architecture).

</Note>

Once the installation finishes successfully, the Medusa Admin dashboard will open with a form to create a new user. Enter the user's credentials and submit the form. Afterward, you can log in with the new user and explore the dashboard.

<Note title="Ran into Errors?">

Check out the [troubleshooting guides](../../../troubleshooting/create-medusa-app-errors/page.mdx) for help.

</Note>

## Step 2: Create a First-Purchase Promotion

Before you apply the first-purchase discount or promotion to a customer's cart, you need to create the promotion that will be applied.

Start your Medusa application with the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Then, open the Medusa Admin dashboard at `http://localhost:9000/app` and log in with the user you created in the previous step.

Next, click on the "Promotions" tab in the left sidebar, then click on the "Create Promotion" button to create a new promotion.

You can customize the promotion based on your use case. For example, it can be a `10%` off the entire order, or a fixed amount off specific items.

Make sure to set the promotion's code to `FIRST_PURCHASE`, as you'll be using this code in your Medusa customization. If you want to use a different code, make sure to update the code in the next steps accordingly.

<Note title="Need help?">

Refer to the [Create Promotions User Guide](!user-guide!/promotions/create) to learn how to create promotions in Medusa.

</Note>

Once you create and publish the promotion, you can proceed to the next steps.

![First-purchase promotion in Medusa Admin](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1750846696/Medusa%20Resources/CleanShot_2025-06-25_at_13.18.00_2x_j46emw.png)

---

## Step 3: Apply the First-Purchase Discount to Cart

In this step, you'll customize the Medusa application to automatically apply the first-purchase promotion to a cart.

To build this feature, you need to:

- Create a [workflow](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows) that implements the logic to apply the first-purchase promotion to a cart.
- Execute the workflow in a [subscriber](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers) that is triggered when a cart is created, or when it's transferred to a customer.

### a. Store the First-Purchase Promotion Code

Since you'll refer to the first-purchase promotion code in multiple places, it's a good idea to store it as a constant in your Medusa application.

So, create the file `src/constants.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/constants.ts"
export const FIRST_PURCHASE_PROMOTION_CODE = "FIRST_PURCHASE"
```

You'll reference this constant in the next steps.

### b. Create the Workflow

Next, you'll create the workflow that implements the logic to apply the first-purchase promotion to a cart.

A [workflow](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows) is a series of actions, called steps, that complete a task with rollback and retry mechanisms. In Medusa, you build commerce features in workflows, then execute them in other customizations, such as subscribers, scheduled jobs, and API routes.

The workflow you'll build will have the following steps:

<WorkflowDiagram
  workflow={{
    name: "applyFirstPurchasePromoWorkflow",
    steps: [
      {
        type: "step",
        name: "useQueryGraphStep",
        description: "Retrieve the cart's details, including its promotions and customer.",
        depth: 1,
        link: "/references/helper-steps/useQueryGraphStep"
      },
      {
        type: "step",
        name: "useQueryGraphStep",
        description: "Retrieve the details of the first-purchase promotion.",
        depth: 2,
        link: "/references/helper-steps/useQueryGraphStep"
      },
      {
        type: "when",
        steps: [
          {
            type: "step",
            name: "updateCartPromotionsStep",
            description: "Add the first-purchase promotion to the cart if the customer is a first-time customer.",
            path: "/references/medusa-workflows/steps/updateCartPromotionsStep",
          }
        ],
        depth: 3
      },
      {
        type: "step",
        name: "useQueryGraphStep",
        description: "Retrieve the updated cart's details, including its promotions.",
        depth: 4,
        link: "/references/helper-steps/useQueryGraphStep"
      }
    ]
  }}
/>

Medusa provides all these steps in its `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package, so you can implement the workflow right away.

To create the workflow, create the file `src/workflows/apply-first-purchase-promo.ts` with the following content:

export const workflowHighlights = [
  ["7", "cart_id", "Receive cart ID as input."],
  ["13", "carts", "Retrieve the cart's details."],
  ["21", "promotions", "Retrieve the first-purchase promotion's details."],
  ["29", "when", "Check if the first-purchase promotion can be applied."],
  ["39", "updateCartPromotionsStep", "Add the first-purchase promotion to the cart."],
  ["47", "updatedCarts", "Retrieve the updated cart's details."],
  ["55", "WorkflowResponse", "Return the updated cart's details."]
]

```ts title="src/workflows/apply-first-purchase-promo.ts" highlights={workflowHighlights}
import { createWorkflow, when, WorkflowResponse } from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
import { updateCartPromotionsStep, useQueryGraphStep } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"
import { FIRST_PURCHASE_PROMOTION_CODE } from "../constants"
import { PromotionActions } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

type WorkflowInput = {
  cart_id: string
}

export const applyFirstPurchasePromoWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "apply-first-purchase-promo",
  (input: WorkflowInput) => {
    const { data: carts } = useQueryGraphStep({
      entity: "cart",
      fields: ["promotions.*", "customer.*", "customer.orders.*"],
      filters: {
        id: input.cart_id,
      },
    })

    const { data: promotions } = useQueryGraphStep({
      entity: "promotion",
      fields: ["code"],
      filters: {
        code: FIRST_PURCHASE_PROMOTION_CODE,
      },
    }).config({ name: "retrieve-promotions" })

    when({ 
      carts,
      promotions,
    }, (data) => {
      return data.promotions.length > 0 && 
        !data.carts[0].promotions?.some((promo) => promo?.id === data.promotions[0].id) && 
        data.carts[0].customer !== null && 
        data.carts[0].customer.orders?.length === 0
    })
    .then(() => {
      updateCartPromotionsStep({
        id: carts[0].id,
        promo_codes: [promotions[0].code!],
        action: PromotionActions.ADD,
      })
    })

    // retrieve updated cart
    const { data: updatedCarts } = useQueryGraphStep({
      entity: "cart",
      fields: ["*", "promotions.*"],
      filters: {
        id: input.cart_id,
      },
    }).config({ name: "retrieve-updated-cart" })

    return new WorkflowResponse(updatedCarts[0])
  }
)
```

You create a workflow using `createWorkflow` from the Workflows SDK. It accepts the workflow's unique name as a first parameter.

`createWorkflow` accepts as a second parameter a constructor function, which is the workflow's implementation. The function accepts as an input an object with the ID of the cart to apply the first-purchase promotion to.

In the workflow's constructor function, you:

- Retrieve the cart's details, including its promotions and customer, using the [useQueryGraphStep](/references/helper-steps/useQueryGraphStep).
- Retrieve the details of the first-purchase promotion using the `useQueryGraphStep`.
    - You pass the `FIRST_PURCHASE_PROMOTION_CODE` constant to the `filters` option to retrieve the promotion.
- Use the [when-then](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows/conditions) utility to only apply the promotion if the first-purchase promotion exists, the cart doesn't have the promotion, and the customer doesn't have any orders. `when` receives two parameters:
    - An object to use in the condition function.
    - A condition function that receives the first parameter object and returns a boolean indicating whether to execute the steps in the `then` block.
- Retrieve the updated cart's details, including its promotions, using the `useQueryGraphStep` again.

Finally, you return a `WorkflowResponse` with the updated cart's details.

<Note title="Why use when-then?">

You can't perform data manipulation in a workflow's constructor function. Instead, the Workflows SDK includes utility functions like `when` to perform typical operations that require accessing data values. Learn more about workflow constraints in the [Workflow Constraints](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows/constructor-constraints) documentation.

</Note>

### c. Create the Subscriber

Next, you'll create a subscriber that executes the workflow when a cart is created or transferred to a customer.

<Note title="Tip">

A cart can be transferred to a customer when they sign up or log in, or in B2B use cases.

</Note>

A [subscriber](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers) is an asynchronous function that listens to events to perform a task. In this case, you'll create a subscriber that listens to the `cart.created` and `cart.customer_transferred` events to execute the workflow.

To create the subscriber, create the file `src/subscribers/apply-first-purchase.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="src/subscribers/apply-first-purchase.ts"
import { SubscriberArgs, type SubscriberConfig } from "@medusajs/framework"
import { applyFirstPurchasePromoWorkflow } from "../workflows/apply-first-purchase-promo"

export default async function cartCreatedHandler({
  event: { data },
  container,
}: SubscriberArgs<{
  id: string
}>) {
  await applyFirstPurchasePromoWorkflow(container)
  .run({
    input: {
      cart_id: data.id,
    },
  })
}

export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
  event: ["cart.created", "cart.customer_transferred"],
}
```

A subscriber file must export:

1. An asynchronous function, which is the subscriber that is executed when the event is emitted.
2. A configuration object that holds the names of the events the subscriber listens to, which are `cart.created` and `cart.customer_transferred` in this case.

The subscriber function receives an object as a parameter that has a `container` property, which is the [Medusa container](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/medusa-container). The Medusa container holds Framework and commerce tools that you can resolve and use in your customizations.

In the subscriber function, you execute the `applyFirstPurchasePromoWorkflow` by invoking it, passing it the Medusa container, then calling its `run` method. You pass the `cart_id` from the event payload as an input to the workflow.

### Test it Out

You can now test the automatic application of the first-purchase promotion to a cart. To do that, you'll use the [Next.js Starter Storefront](../../../nextjs-starter/page.mdx) you installed in the first step.

<Note title="Reminder" forceMultiline>

The Next.js Starter Storefront was installed in a separate directory from Medusa. The directory's name is `{your-project}-storefront`.

So, if your Medusa application's directory is `medusa-first-promo`, you can find the storefront by going back to the parent directory and changing to the `medusa-first-promo-storefront` directory:

```bash
cd ../medusa-first-promo-storefront # change based on your project name
```

</Note>

First, start the Medusa application with the following command:

```bash npm2yarn badgeLabel="Medusa Application" badgeColor="green"
npm run dev
```

Then, start the Next.js Starter Storefront with the following command:

```bash npm2yarn badgeLabel="Storefront" badgeColor="blue"
npm run dev
```

The storefront will run at `http://localhost:8000`. Open it in your browser and click on Account at the top right to register.

After you register, add a product to the cart, then go to the cart page. You'll find that the `FIRST_PURCHASE` promotion has been applied to the cart automatically.

![Cart page with first-purchase promotion applied](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1750842319/Medusa%20Resources/CleanShot_2025-06-25_at_12.02.17_2x_bbu8vt.png)

---

## Step 4: Validate First-Purchase Discount Usage

You now automatically apply the first-purchase promotion to a cart, but any customer can use the promotion code at the moment.

So, you need to add custom validation to ensure that the first-purchase promotion is only used by first-time customers.

In this step, you'll customize Medusa's existing workflows to validate the first-purchase promotion usage. You can do that by consuming the [workflows' hooks](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks). A workflow hook is a point in a workflow where you can inject custom functionality as a step function.

You'll consume the hooks of the following workflows:

- [updateCartPromotionsWorkflow](/references/medusa-workflows/updateCartPromotionsWorkflow): This workflow is used to add or remove promotions from a cart. You'll check that the customer is a first-time customer before allowing the promotion to be added.
- [completeCartWorkflow](/references/medusa-workflows/completeCartWorkflow): This workflow is used to complete a cart and place an order. You'll validate that the first-purchase promotion is only used by first-time customers before allowing the order to be placed.

### a. Consume `updateCartPromotionsWorkflow.validate` Hook

You'll start by consuming the `validate` hook of the `updateCartPromotionsWorkflow`. This hook is called before any operations are performed in the workflow.

To consume the hook, create the file `src/workflows/hooks/validate-promotion.ts` with the following content:

export const validatePromotionHighlights = [
  ["9", "hasFirstPurchasePromo", "Check if the first-purchase promotion is being applied."],
  ["17", "", "Throw an error if the cart isn't associated with a customer."],
  ["25", "customer", "Retrieve the customer associated with the cart."],
  ["33", "", "Throw an error if the customer doesn't have an account or has previous orders."],
]

```ts title="src/workflows/hooks/validate-promotion.ts" highlights={validatePromotionHighlights}
import { 
  updateCartPromotionsWorkflow,
} from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"
import { FIRST_PURCHASE_PROMOTION_CODE } from "../../constants"
import { MedusaError } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

updateCartPromotionsWorkflow.hooks.validate(
  (async ({ input, cart }, { container }) => {
    const hasFirstPurchasePromo = input.promo_codes?.some(
      (code) => code === FIRST_PURCHASE_PROMOTION_CODE
    )

    if (!hasFirstPurchasePromo) {
      return
    }

    if (!cart.customer_id) {
      throw new MedusaError(
        MedusaError.Types.INVALID_DATA,
        "First purchase discount can only be applied to carts with a customer"
      )
    }
    const query = container.resolve("query")

    const { data: [customer] } = await query.graph({
      entity: "customer",
      fields: ["orders.*", "has_account"],
      filters: {
        id: cart.customer_id,
      },
    })

    if (!customer.has_account || (customer?.orders?.length || 0) > 0) {
      throw new MedusaError(
        MedusaError.Types.INVALID_DATA,
        "First purchase discount can only be applied to carts with no previous orders"
      )
    }
  })
)
```

You consume a workflow's hook by calling the `hooks` property of the workflow, then calling the hook you want to consume. In this case, you call the `validate` hook of the `updateCartPromotionsWorkflow`.

The `validate` hook receives a step function as a parameter. The function receives two parameters:

- The hook's input, which differs based on the workflow. In this case, it receives the following properties:
  - `input`: The input of the `updateCartPromotionsWorkflow`, which includes the `promo_codes` to add or remove from the cart.
  - `cart`: The cart being updated.
- The hook or step context object. Most notably, it has a `container` property, which is the Medusa container.

In the step function, you check if the `FIRST_PURCHASE_PROMOTION_CODE` is being applied to the cart. If so, you validate that:

- The cart is associated with a customer.
- The customer has an account.
- The customer has no previous orders.

If any of these validations fail, you throw a `MedusaError` with the appropriate error message. This will prevent the promotion from being applied to the cart.

<Note title="Tip">

To retrieve the customer's details, you use [Query](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/module-links/query). Query allows you to retrieve data across modules in your Medusa application.

</Note>

### b. Consume `completeCartWorkflow.validate` Hook

Next, you'll consume the `validate` hook of the `completeCartWorkflow`. This workflow is used to complete a cart and place an order. You'll validate that the first-purchase promotion is only used by first-time customers before allowing the order to be placed.

In the same `src/workflows/hooks/validate-promotion.ts` file, add the following import at the top of the file:

```ts title="src/workflows/hooks/validate-promotion.ts"
import { 
  completeCartWorkflow,
} from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"
```

Then, consume the hook at the end of the file:

export const validateCartCompletionHighlights = [
  ["3", "hasFirstPurchasePromo", "Check if the first-purchase promotion is being applied."],
  ["11", "", "Throw an error if the cart isn't associated with a customer."],
  ["20", "customer", "Retrieve the customer associated with the cart."],
  ["28", "", "Throw an error if the customer doesn't have an account or has previous orders."],
]

```ts title="src/workflows/hooks/validate-promotion.ts" highlights={validateCartCompletionHighlights}
completeCartWorkflow.hooks.validate(
  (async ({ input, cart }, { container }) => {
    const hasFirstPurchasePromo = cart.promotions?.some(
      (promo) => promo?.code === FIRST_PURCHASE_PROMOTION_CODE
    )

    if (!hasFirstPurchasePromo) {
      return
    }

    if (!cart.customer_id) {
      throw new MedusaError(
        MedusaError.Types.INVALID_DATA,
        "First purchase discount can only be applied to carts with a customer"
      )
    }

    const query = container.resolve("query")

    const { data: [customer] } = await query.graph({
      entity: "customer",
      fields: ["orders.*", "has_account"],
      filters: {
        id: cart.customer_id,
      },
    })

    if (!customer.has_account || (customer?.orders?.length || 0) > 0) {
      throw new MedusaError(
        MedusaError.Types.INVALID_DATA,
        "First purchase discount can only be applied to carts with no previous orders"
      )
    }
  })
)
```

You consume the `validate` hook of the `completeCartWorkflow` in the same way as the previous hook. The step function receives the cart being completed as an input.

In the step function, you check if the `FIRST_PURCHASE_PROMOTION_CODE` is applied to the cart. If so, you validate that:

- The cart is associated with a customer.
- The customer has an account.
- The customer has no previous orders.

If any of these validations fail, you throw a `MedusaError` with the appropriate error message. This will prevent the order from being placed if the first-purchase promotion is used by a customer who is not a first-time customer.

### Test it Out

To test the custom validation, start the Medusa application and the Next.js Starter Storefront as you did in the previous steps.

Then, register a new customer in the storefront, and place an order. The first-purchase promotion will be applied to the cart automatically and the order will be placed successfully.

Try to place another order with the same customer. The first-purchase promotion will not be automatically applied to the cart. If you also try to apply the first-purchase promotion manually, you'll receive an error message indicating that the promotion can only be applied to first-time customers.

---

## Step 5: Show Discount Pop-Up in Storefront

The first-time purchase promotion is now fully functional. However, you need to inform first-time customers about the discount and encourage them to sign up.

To do that, you'll customize the Next.js Starter Storefront to show a pop-up when a first-time customer visits the storefront.

### a. Create the Pop-Up Component

You'll first create the pop-up component that will be displayed to first-time customers.

Create the file `src/modules/common/components/discount-popup/index.tsx` with the following content:

```tsx title="src/modules/common/components/discount-popup/index.tsx" badgeLabel="Storefront" badgeColor="blue"
"use client"

import { Button, Heading, Text } from "@medusajs/ui"
import Modal from "@modules/common/components/modal"
import useToggleState from "@lib/hooks/use-toggle-state"
import { useEffect } from "react"
import LocalizedClientLink from "@modules/common/components/localized-client-link"

const DISCOUNT_POPUP_KEY = "discount_popup_shown"

const DiscountPopup = () => {
  const { state, open, close } = useToggleState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if the popup has been shown before
    const hasBeenShown = localStorage.getItem(DISCOUNT_POPUP_KEY)
    
    if (!hasBeenShown) {
      open()
      // Mark as shown
      localStorage.setItem(DISCOUNT_POPUP_KEY, "true")
    }
  }, [open])

  return (
    <Modal isOpen={state} close={close} size="small" data-testid="discount-popup">
      <div className="relative overflow-hidden bg-gradient-to-br from-amber-50 to-amber-100 rounded-t-lg px-6 pt-8 pb-6">

          <div className="text-xs text-gray-400 text-center mt-2">
            *Discount applies to your first order only
          </div>
        </div>
      </Modal.Body>
    </Modal>
  )
}

export default DiscountPopup
```

This component uses the `Modal` component that is already available in the Next.js Starter Storefront. It displays a pop-up with a discount offer and two buttons: one to register and save the discount, and another to close the pop-up.

The pop-up will only be shown to first-time customers. Once the pop-up is shown, a `discount_popup_shown` key is stored in the local storage to prevent it from being shown again.

### b. Add the Pop-Up to Layout

To ensure that the pop-up is displayed when the customer visits the storefront, you need to add the `DiscountPopup` component to the main layout of the Next.js Starter Storefront.

In `src/app/[countryCode]/(main)/layout.tsx`, add the following import at the top of the file:

```tsx title="src/app/[countryCode]/(main)/layout.tsx" badgeLabel="Storefront" badgeColor="blue"
import DiscountPopup from "@modules/common/components/discount-popup"
```

Then, in the return statement of the `PageLayout` component, add the `DiscountPopup` component before rendering `props.children`:

```tsx title="src/app/[countryCode]/(main)/layout.tsx" badgeLabel="Storefront" badgeColor="blue"
<>
  {/* ... */}
  {!customer && <DiscountPopup />}
  {props.children}
  {/* ... */}
</>
```

Notice that you only display the pop-up if the customer is not logged in. This way, the pop-up will only be shown to first-time customers.

### c. Show Registration Form Before Login

If you go to the `/account` page in the Next.js Starter Storefront as a guest customer, you'll see the login form. However, in this case, you want to show the registration form first instead.

To change this behavior, in `src/modules/account/templates/login-template.tsx`, change the default value of `currentView` to `"register"`:

```tsx title="src/modules/account/templates/login-template.tsx" badgeLabel="Storefront" badgeColor="blue"
const [currentView, setCurrentView] = useState("register")
```

This way, when a guest customer visits the `/account` page, they will see the registration form instead of the login form.

### Test it Out

To test the pop-up, start the Medusa application and the Next.js Starter Storefront as you did in the previous steps.

Then, open the storefront in your browser. If you're a first-time customer, you'll see the discount pop-up encouraging you to sign up and receive the first-purchase discount.

<Note title="Tip">

If you don't see the pop-up, make sure that you're logged out.

## Next Steps

You've now implemented the first-purchase discount feature in Medusa. You can add more features to build customer loyalty, such as a [loyalty points system](../loyalty-points/page.mdx) or [product reviews](../product-reviews/page.mdx).

If you're new to Medusa, check out the [main documentation](!docs!/learn), where you'll get a more in-depth understanding of all the concepts you've used in this guide and more.
