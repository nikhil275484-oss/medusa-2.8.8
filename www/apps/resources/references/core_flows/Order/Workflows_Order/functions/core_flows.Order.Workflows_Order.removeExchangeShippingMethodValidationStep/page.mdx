# removeExchangeShippingMethodValidationStep - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `removeExchangeShippingMethodValidationStep`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This step validates that a shipping method can be removed from an exchange.
If the exchange is canceled, the order change is not active, the shipping method
doesn't exist, or the action isn't adding a shipping method, the step will throw an error.

:::note

You can retrieve an order exchange and order change details using [Query](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/module-links/query),
or [useQueryGraphStep](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/references/medusa-workflows/steps/useQueryGraphStep).

:::

## Example

```ts
const data = removeExchangeShippingMethodValidationStep({
  orderChange: {
    id: "orch_123",
    // other order change details...
  },
  orderExchange: {
    id: "exchange_123",
    // other order exchange details...
  },
  input: {
    exchange_id: "exchange_123",
    action_id: "orchact_123",
  }
})
```
