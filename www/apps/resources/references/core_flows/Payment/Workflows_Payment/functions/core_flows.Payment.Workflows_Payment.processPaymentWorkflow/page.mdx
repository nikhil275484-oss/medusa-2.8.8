# processPaymentWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `processPaymentWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow processes a payment to either complete its associated cart,
capture the payment, or authorize the payment session. It's used when a
[Webhook Event is received](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/commerce-modules/payment/webhook-events).

You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you
to process a payment in your custom flows based on a webhook action.

## Emitted Events

This section lists the events that are either triggered by the `emitEventStep` in the workflow, or by another workflow executed within this workflow.

You can listen to these events in a subscriber, as explained in the [Subscribers](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers) documentation.
