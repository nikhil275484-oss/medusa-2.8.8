# list

This method retrieves a list of refund reasons. It sends a request to the 
[List Refund Reasons](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#refund-reasons\_getrefundreasons)
API route.

## Example

To retrieve the list of refund reasons:

```ts
sdk.admin.refundReason.list()
.then(({ refund_reasons, count, limit, offset }) => {
  console.log(refund_reasons)
})
```

To configure the pagination, pass the `limit` and `offset` query parameters.

For example, to retrieve only 10 items and skip 10 items:

```ts
sdk.admin.refundReason.list({
  limit: 10,
  offset: 10
})
.then(({ refund_reasons, count, limit, offset }) => {
  console.log(refund_reasons)
})
```

Using the `fields` query parameter, you can specify the fields and relations to retrieve
in each refund reason:

```ts
sdk.admin.refundReason.list({
  fields: "id,name"
})
.then(({ refund_reasons, count, limit, offset }) => {
  console.log(refund_reasons)
})
```

Learn more about the `fields` property in the [API reference](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#select-fields-and-relations).
