# workflowExecution - JS SDK Admin Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `sdk.admin.workflowExecution` set of methods used to send requests to Medusa's Admin API routes.

## list

This method retrieves a list of workflow executions. It sends a request to the
[List Workflow Executions](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#workflows-executions\_getworkflowsexecutions)
API route.

### Example

To retrieve the list of workflow executions:

```ts
sdk.admin.workflowExecution.list()
.then(({ workflow_executions, count, limit, offset }) => {
  console.log(workflow_executions)
})
```

To configure the pagination, pass the `limit` and `offset` query parameters.

For example, to retrieve only 10 items and skip 10 items:

```ts
sdk.admin.workflowExecution.list({
  limit: 10,
  offset: 10
})
.then(({ workflow_executions, count, limit, offset }) => {
  console.log(workflow_executions)
})
```

Using the `fields` query parameter, you can specify the fields and relations to retrieve
in each workflow execution:

```ts
sdk.admin.workflowExecution.list({
  fields: "id,name"
})
.then(({ workflow_executions, count, limit, offset }) => {
  console.log(workflow_executions)
})
```

Learn more about the `fields` property in the [API reference](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#select-fields-and-relations).

## retrieve

This method retrieves a workflow execution by its ID. It sends a request to the
[Get Workflow Execution](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#workflows-executions\_getworkflowsexecutionsworkflow\_idtransaction\_id)
API route.

### Example

```ts
sdk.admin.workflowExecution.retrieve("wrk_123")
.then(({ workflow_execution }) => {
  console.log(workflow_execution)
})
```
