  summary: Get Presigned Upload URL
  description: >-
    Get a presigned URL for uploading a file to the configured File Module
    Provider. The presigned URL can be used to upload files directly to the
    third-party provider. This only works if your configured provider supports
    presigned URLs, such as the S3 provider.
