In this guide, you'll learn about organizations in Cloud and how to manage them.

## What is an Organization?

In Cloud, an organization is a group of users that have access to the same settings, projects, resources, environments, and billing details.

As a user, you must be in an organization to create and deploy projects. A user can be a member of multiple organizations.

You can create a new organization when you sign up for Cloud. This will make you the organization's owner.

You can also join an existing organization by [receiving an invite from a user in that organization](#invite-members-to-organization).

## Organization Dashboard

When you open the Cloud dashboard and log in, you're viewing the projects, resources, and settings of a specific organization. You'll find the name of that organization at the top left of the dashboard.
