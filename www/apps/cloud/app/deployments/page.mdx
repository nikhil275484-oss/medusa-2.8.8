In this guide, you'll learn about deployments, how they're created, and how you can troubleshoot them in Cloud.

## Deployments Overview

Each [environment](../environments/page.mdx) has at least one deployment, which is publicly accessible at the [environment's URL](#find-environments-url).

A deployment is created from the latest source code of an [environment](../environments/page.mdx)'s branch. An environment can have only one live deployment at a time.

The latest deployment of an environment is the live version of that environment, unless you [redeploy a previous deployment](#redeploy-a-deployment).

### How are Deployments Created?

For long-lived environments, Medusa creates a new deployment every time you push a new commit to the environment's branch. For example, if your Production environment is connected to the `main` branch, Medusa will create a new Production deployment every time you push a new commit to the `main` branch.

For short-lived preview environments, Medusa creates a new environment and deployment when you open a pull request. Medusa will redeploy the preview environment every time you push a new commit to the pull request branch.

## Find Project Deployments

You can find the deployments for a project in its dashboard.

To find the deployments for a project:

1. Make sure you're viewing the [correct organization's dashboard in Cloud](../organizations/page.mdx#switch-organization).
2. Click on the project you want to view its deployments.
3. Click on the "Deployments" tab in the project's dashboard.

You'll find all deployments for the project's environments in the "Deployments" tab, sorted in descending order. For each deployment, you can see its branch, environment, status, and more.

---


## Find Environment Deployments

You can find the deployments for an environment in the project and environment dashboards.

For example, to find the deployments for the Production environment:

1. [Go to its project's dashboard](../projects/page.mdx#open-project-dashboard).
2. You can go to the latest Production deployment's details by clicking the "Latest Deployment" link in the Production environment card.

![Production environment card in the Cloud dashboard with the "Latest Deployment" link prominently highlighted, providing quick access to view details about the most recent deployment including status, commit information, and deployment logs](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1750146946/Cloud/CleanShot_2025-06-17_at_10.54.05_2x_ksw4nk.png)

3. To find a list of all deployments, click on the "Production" environment card to open the environment's dashboard.
    - The "Latest update" card shows details about the latest deployment.
    - The "Deployments" card shows the list of all previous deployments.

![Production environment details page with deployment cards highlighted](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1750151060/Cloud/CleanShot_2025-06-17_at_10.57.49_2x_wqrfzf.png)

The last step applies to all environments in your project, including custom environments (like Staging) and preview environments.

## Find Deployment Details

You'll often need to check a deployment's details, such as its status, commit information, and logs.

To view a deployment's details:

1. [Go to its project's dashboard](../projects/page.mdx#open-project-dashboard).
2. If you're looking for the latest deployment:
    - Click the "Latest Deployment" link in its environment's card.
3. If you're looking for an older deployment:
    - Click on its environment's card to open its dashboard.
    - In the "Deployments" card, click on the deployment you want to view.

This will open the deployment's details page, where you can also see the deployment's commit at the top of the page.

On the deployment details page, you'll find:

![Deployment details page with key sections highlighted](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1750147821/Cloud/CleanShot_2025-06-17_at_11.08.58_2x_ea1l8s.png)

1. **Commit**: The commit that the deployment was created from.
2. **Status**: The current [status](#deployment-statuses-and-lifecycle) of the deployment. For example, "Live" or "Build Failed".
3. **Author**: The GitHub user who pushed the commit that created the deployment.
4. **Build Logs**: The logs from the build process. They are useful to understand why a deployment failed. Learn more in the [Logs](../logs/page.mdx) guide.

### Switch Between Deployments

The deployment's commit at the top of the Cloud dashboard is also a deployment switcher.

To switch to a different deployment:

1. Click on the deployment's commit at the top of the Cloud dashboard, next to the environment's name.
2. Choose the deployment you want to switch to from the dropdown.

![Deployment switcher at the top of the deployment details page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1750148493/Cloud/CleanShot_2025-06-17_at_11.20.16_2x_jegncv.png)

This will change the view to the selected deployment and you'll see its details and logs.

---

## Access Live Deployment

You can only access a deployment once its status is "Live". You can access it through its environment's URL.

### Find Environment's URL

<Note>

For preview environments, refer to the [Preview Environments](../environments/preview/page.mdx#access-deployed-preview-environment) guide to find the URL of the preview environment.

</Note>

An environment's URL is in the format `<subdomain>.medusajs.app`, where `<subdomain>` is the subdomain you set either when [creating its project](../projects/page.mdx#create-a-project) or when [creating the environment](../environments/long-lived/page.mdx#create-a-long-lived-environment).

You can also find the URL of a deployment's environment through the Cloud dashboard:

1. Select a project from the [organization's dashboard](../organizations/page.mdx#organization-dashboard).
2. In the project's dashboard, find the URL in the environment's card under its name. For example, find the production URL in the Production environment card.

<Note title="Why are there two URLs?">

Aside from the subdomain you set when [creating the environment](../environments/long-lived/page.mdx#create-a-long-lived-environment), Medusa also provides a unique, randomly generated URL for each environment. Both of these URLs point to the same deployment.

</Note>

![URL of environment in its card under the environment's name](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1750157464/Cloud/CleanShot_2025-06-17_at_13.50.38_2x_nfxy1t.png)

3. You can also click on the environment's name to open its dashboard, where you'll find the URL under the environment's name.

![URL of environment in its dashboard under the environment's name](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1750081257/Cloud/CleanShot_2025-06-16_at_16.40.37_2x_vxupew.png)

### Access the Deployment's Medusa Admin

To access the Medusa Admin of a live deployment, click on [the environment's URL](#find-environments-url).

You can then log in using the email and password set either [during project creation](../projects/page.mdx#create-a-project) or [in the environment's variables](../environments/long-lived/page.mdx#create-medusa-admin-user-in-environment).

### Send Requests to the Deployment

You can send requests to a live deployment's API routes using its URL.

For example, to check the health of the live deployment, you can send a `GET` request to the `/health` endpoint:

```bash
curl https://my-project.medusajs.app/health
```

Where `my-project` is the subdomain you set either when [creating the project](../projects/page.mdx#create-a-project) or when [creating the environment](../environments/long-lived/page.mdx#create-a-long-lived-environment).

### Access Deployment's Server through SSH

Medusa doesn't support SSH access to the server instance of a deployment. However, you can still access the server's [runtime and build logs](../logs/page.mdx) to debug issues in your application.

If this isn't sufficient for your use case, you can contact support to discuss alternatives.

## Deployment Statuses and Lifecycle

A deployment can have one of the following statuses:

<Table>
  <Table.Header>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.HeaderCell>
        Status
      </Table.HeaderCell>
      <Table.HeaderCell>
        Description
      </Table.HeaderCell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Header>
  <Table.Body>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Building
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The deployment is currently being built. This is the initial status of a deployment.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Build canceled
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The build process was canceled due to a newer commit pushed to the branch, which resulted in a new deployment.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Build failed
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The build process failed due to a build error. You can check the [build logs](../logs/page.mdx) to troubleshoot the issue.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Awaiting deployment
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The deployment has finished building and is waiting to be deployed.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Deploying
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The deployment is currently being deployed.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Deploy failed
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The deployment failed during the deployment process. You can check the [Runtime Logs](../logs/page.mdx) to troubleshoot the issue.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Live
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The deployment finished successfully and is now the live version of the environment.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Ready
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The deployment was previously deployed, but it's not currently the live version of the environment. This happens when a new deployment becomes the live version.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Body>
</Table>

So, the lifecycle of a successful deployment is Building → Awaiting deployment → Deploying → Live. Then, once a new deployment is created, the previous deployment's status changes to Ready.

<Note>

If a deployment is stuck at a status like "Building" or "Deploying" for a long time, contact support for assistance.

## Troubleshooting Failed Deployments

### Troubleshooting Build Failures

If a deployment's status is "Build failed", you can check the [build logs](../logs/page.mdx) to understand why it failed. The build logs will show you the errors that occurred during the build process, which can help you fix the issue in your code.

You can also contact support for help with the issue, if necessary.

### Troubleshooting Deployment Failures

If a deployment's status is "Deploy failed", you can check the [runtime logs](../logs/page.mdx) to understand why it failed. The runtime logs will show you the errors that occurred during the deployment process, which can help you fix the issue in your code.

You can also contact support for help with the issue, if necessary.

---

## Redeploy a Deployment

You might need to redeploy an old deployment if there are unexpected issues with the current live deployment.

By redeploying a previous deployment, you revert or rollback the live version of its environment to the code in that deployment's commit.

<Note title="Important">

Redeploying a deployment will not revert database changes made in the latest deployment. If you need to revert database changes, contact support for assistance based on your use case.

</Note>

To redeploy a deployment:

1. [Go to the deployment's details page](#find-deployment-details).
2. Click the "Redeploy" button at the top right of the page.

![Redeploy button highlighted on the deployment details page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1750156363/Cloud/CleanShot_2025-06-17_at_13.31.17_2x_i6lfit.png)

This will trigger the redeployment process for the selected deployment. The deployment will go through [the same lifecycle](#deployment-statuses-and-lifecycle) as a new deployment.

Once the redeployment is complete, the deployment's status will change to "Live" and it will become the new live version of the environment.

---

## Change Deployment Rules

For each environment, you can change the rules that trigger a new deployment. For example, you can change the branch that the environment is connected to, which changes when a new deployment is created.

<Note>

Changing the branch associted with an environment only works for long-lived environments.

</Note>

To change the deployment rules for an environment:

1. [Go to the environment's dashboard](#find-environment-deployments).
2. Click on the "Settings" tab.
3. Scroll down to the "Deployment rules" section. You'll find a `branch` rule in this section.

![Deployment rules section in the environment's settings tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1750171235/Cloud/CleanShot_2025-06-17_at_17.40.13_2x_v0vn1k.png)

4. You can edit it by clicking the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> icon and choosing "Edit" from the dropdown.
5. In the side window that opens, you can change the branch that the environment is connected to. For example, you can change it from `main` to `staging` to create a new deployment every time you push a commit to the `staging` branch.
6. Click "Save" to apply the changes.

The deployment rules will take effect for next deployments. For example, if you change the branch to `staging`, the next deployment will be created from the latest commit in the `staging` branch.

![Change environment branch in the environment's settings tab](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1750170517/Cloud/CleanShot_2025-06-17_at_17.28.25_2x_nfx79a.png)
