In this guide, you'll learn how to manage your billing and usage details in Cloud.

## Billing and Usage Overview

After signing up for Cloud, you can view and manage your organization's billing and usage details in the Cloud dashboard.

This is useful if you want to make sure you're not exceeding your usage limits, understand your plan's offerings, and manage your billing details.

## Manage Payment Method

You can manage the payment methods used for the monthly Cloud payment subscriptions for your organization.

### Add Payment Method to Organization

To add a payment method that can be used for Cloud payments in an organization:

1. Make sure you're viewing the [correct organization's dashboard in Cloud](../organizations/page.mdx#switch-organization).
2. Click on the [organization switcher](../organizations/page.mdx#switch-organization) at the top left of the Cloud dashboard.
3. Choose "Organization Settings" from the dropdown.
4. Change to the "Billing" settings from the sidebar.
5. In the "Payment methods" section, click the "Add new" button.
6. This will open a form where you can add credit card details.
7. Once you're done, click the "Save" button.

### Set Payment Method as Default

When Cloud captures the subscription payment for your organization, it first uses the default payment method in your organization. If payment fails, Cloud tries to use other payment methods in the organization, if available.

When you have multiple payment methods added to your organization, you can change the default payment method.

To change the default payment method:

1. Make sure you're viewing the [correct organization's dashboard in Cloud](../organizations/page.mdx#switch-organization).
2. Click on the [organization switcher](../organizations/page.mdx#switch-organization) at the top left of the Cloud dashboard.
3. Choose "Organization Settings" from the dropdown.
4. Change to the "Billing" settings from the sidebar.
5. In the "Payment methods" section, find the payment method you want to set as default.
6. Click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> icon next to the payment method.
7. Choose "Set as default" from the dropdown.

The next time Cloud captures the subscription payment for your organization, it will use this payment method first.

## Handle Unsuccessful Payments

If a payment for your organization's subscription fails, you'll receive a [notification](../notifications/page.mdx) in the Cloud dashboard.

The payment may fail for various reasons, such as insufficient funds, an expired card, or other issues with the payment method. Make sure to [update your payment method](#manage-payment-method) if needed.

If there are no issues with your payment method and the payment still fails, contact support for assistance.
